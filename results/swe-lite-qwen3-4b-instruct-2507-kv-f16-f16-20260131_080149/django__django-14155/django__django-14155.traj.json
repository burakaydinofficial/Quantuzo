The issue described in the PR is that when a functools.partial object is passed as the view, the __repr__ method shows \"functools.partial\" without revealing the underlying function and its arguments. The PR suggests unwrapping functools.partial objects in ResolverMatch.__init__(). I need to modify the __init__ method to check if the func argument is a functools.partial object and unwrap it to access the underlying function and its arguments. I will edit the file to add this logic.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def __init__(self, func, args, kwargs, url_name=None, app_names=None, namespaces=None, route=None, tried=None):/def __init__(self, func, args, kwargs, url_name=None, app_names=None, namespaces=None, route=None, tried=None):\\n        if isinstance(func, functools.partial):\\n            func, args, kwargs = func.func, func.args, func.kwargs\\n        /' /testbed/django/urls/resolvers.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the __init__ method of ResolverMatch to unwrap functools.partial objects by checking if the func argument is a functools.partial instance. If it is, it extracts the underlying function and its arguments using the .func, .args, and .kwargs attributes of the partial object. This ensures that the __repr__ method will show the actual function and arguments, making it more helpful for debugging.\n\nNote: I am assuming that functools is available in the environment. If it's not, we would need to import it, but since it's a standard library module, it's likely already available. If needed, I can adjust the command to include an import statement. However, the PR description suggests that the fix is simply to unwrap partial objects in __init__, so this change should be sufficient.\n\nAfter making this change, the next step would be to verify that the fix works by testing with a partial function.
