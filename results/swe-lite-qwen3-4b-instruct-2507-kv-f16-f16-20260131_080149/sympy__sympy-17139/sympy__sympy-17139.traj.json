Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

I have already identified the correct line and replaced the invalid comparison with a safe one that checks if the exponent is real before comparing its value. The fix ensures that the code only performs the comparison when the exponent is a real number, avoiding invalid operations with complex numbers. This change is consistent with the codebase's design and resolves the TypeError.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '504c\\        if rv.exp.is_real and rv.exp < 0:' sympy/simplify/fu.py\n```",
