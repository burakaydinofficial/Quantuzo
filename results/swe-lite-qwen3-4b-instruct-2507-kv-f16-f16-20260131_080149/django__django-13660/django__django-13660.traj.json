Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

According to the PR description, passing an empty dictionary as the second argument to `exec` would provide a minimal set of globals and fix the issue. I will modify the `handle` method to pass an empty dictionary to `exec` when executing the command or reading stdin. This change will ensure that the `django` module and other necessary globals are available in the execution context.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|exec(options['command'])|exec(options['command'], {})|g' django/core/management/commands/shell.py && \\\nsed -i 's|exec(sys.stdin.read())|exec(sys.stdin.read(), {})|g' django/core/management/commands/shell.py\n```\n",
