                "content": "THOUGHT: The `runshell` method is called with `options[\"parameters\"]` as the argument list, and the database name is passed as `options[\"database\"]`. The current implementation already passes `options[\"parameters\"]` first and then `options[\"database\"]`, which is correct \u2014 the database name should be the last argument, and all other arguments (like `-c`) should come before it. The issue described in the PR arises because the `--` prefix is being interpreted as a parameter, not as a flag to pass arguments to `psql`. This suggests that the `parameters` list is being incorrectly parsed \u2014 specifically, when `--` is used, it is being treated as a parameter, not as a delimiter for arguments to be passed to `psql`.\n\nThe root cause is in the argument parsing logic. The `parameters` argument is collected with `nargs=\"*\"` and passed directly to `runshell`, but the `--` prefix is being interpreted as a parameter rather than as a flag to pass arguments to `psql`. To fix this, we need to ensure that arguments passed after `--` are treated as arguments to `psql`, not as parameters to the command.\n\nThe correct solution is to modify the `handle` method to ensure that the `parameters` list is properly constructed and passed to `runshell` such that all arguments (like `-c`) come before the database name. The current implementation already does this, so the issue might be in how the `parameters` list is being interpreted \u2014 specifically, the `--` prefix might be being treated as a parameter.\n\nI will now verify the exact call to `runshell` and ensure that the arguments are being passed correctly.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"runshell\" /testbed/django/core/management/commands/dbshell.py\n```\n\nThis will help identify how the `runshell` method is being called and whether there is a specific configuration for argument ordering.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"runshell\" /testbed/django/core/management/commands/dbshell.py\n```",
