A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The PR description highlights a problem in the AffinityPropagation implementation where non-converged clustering returns incorrect values (e.g., [2] and [0,0,0]) instead of the expected empty list and -1 labels. The issue is that the algorithm does not properly signal failure when it fails to converge. The user expects either -1 labels or a convergence flag to detect non-convergence. To fix this, I need to locate the AffinityPropagation implementation in scikit-learn and modify it to return empty cluster_centers_indices and -1 labels when convergence is not achieved. The most likely file is sklearn/cluster/affinity_propagation.py.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The file `_affinity_propagation.py` contains the implementation of the AffinityPropagation algorithm. The PR description highlights that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices` and -1 for all labels. However, the current implementation in the `predict` method returns -1 labels only when there are no cluster centers, which is a correct behavior. The issue described in the PR is that the user expects to be able to detect non-convergence explicitly, and the current behavior might not be clear enough.\n\nThe key part of the code is in the `predict` method, where it checks if `self.cluster_centers_.shape[0] > 0` and returns -1 labels if there are no cluster centers. This is consistent with the documentation. However, the PR suggests that the user should be able to detect non-convergence more explicitly, such as through a property or a flag. The current implementation already returns -1 labels when convergence fails, which satisfies the requirement. The issue might be that the user does not know that the algorithm failed to converge, and there is no explicit flag or property to indicate this.\n\nTo improve the situation, I will add a property to the AffinityPropagation class that indicates whether the algorithm converged. This will allow users to explicitly check if the clustering failed to converge. I will modify the `fit` method to set a convergence flag and expose it via a property.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, self.n_iter_ = /cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, self.n_iter_, self.converged_ = /' /testbed/sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the `fit` method to include a `converged_` flag that is set to `True` if the algorithm converged and `False` otherwise.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The file `_affinity_propagation.py` contains the implementation of the AffinityPropagation algorithm. The PR description highlights that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices` and -1 for all labels. However, the current implementation in the `predict` method returns -1 labels only when there are no cluster centers, which is a correct behavior. The issue described in the PR is that the user expects to be able to detect non-convergence explicitly, and the current behavior might not be clear enough.\n\nThe key part of the code is in the `predict` method, where it checks if `self.cluster_centers_.shape[0] > 0` and returns -1 labels if there are no cluster centers. This is consistent with the documentation. However, the PR suggests that the user should be able to detect non-convergence more explicitly, such as through a property or a flag. The current implementation already returns -1 labels when convergence fails, which satisfies the requirement. The issue might be that the user does not know that the algorithm failed to converge, and there is no explicit flag or property to indicate this.\n\nTo improve the situation, I will add a property to the AffinityPropagation class that indicates whether the algorithm converged. This will allow users to explicitly check if the clustering failed to converge. I will modify the `fit` method to set a convergence flag and expose it via a property.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, self.n_iter_ = /cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, self.n_iter_, self.converged_ = /' /testbed/sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the `fit` method to include a `converged_` flag that is set to `True` if the algorithm converged and `False` otherwise.
