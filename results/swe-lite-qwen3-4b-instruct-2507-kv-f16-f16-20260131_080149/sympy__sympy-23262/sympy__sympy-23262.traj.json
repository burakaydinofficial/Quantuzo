I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The previous `sed` command incorrectly modified the code. The function `_convert_python_lists` is designed to handle tuples recursively, and the current implementation already uses a generator expression to convert each element. However, the issue arises when a singleton tuple is passed, and the code fails to add a comma. The correct fix should ensure that when the tuple has only one element, it is properly formatted with a comma. The current implementation in the file does not handle singleton tuples correctly because it simply returns a tuple of converted elements without checking the length. I need to modify the function to add a comma for singleton tuples. The correct approach is to check if the tuple has only one element and format it accordingly.\n\nI will now edit the file to ensure that singleton tuples are properly formatted with a comma.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/return tuple(_convert_python_lists(e) for e in arg)/return tuple(_convert_python_lists(e) for e in arg) if len(arg) > 1 else (arg[0],)/' /testbed/sympy/printing/codeprinter.py\n```\n\nThis change ensures that for singleton tuples (length 1), a comma is added to properly represent a tuple, while for tuples with two or more elements, the original behavior is preserved. This will fix the issue described in the PR where a singleton tuple is incorrectly generated without a comma.\n\nAfter this change, I will verify the fix by running the provided MWE.\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"import inspect; from sympy import lambdify; print(inspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1]))) )\"\n```",
