Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

                "content": "THOUGHT: I now have the exact context of the problematic line. The issue is on line 291, where `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)` appears in the code. The division by `n_class` can cause a ZeroDivisionError when `n_class` is 1 or less (e.g., when there are no support vectors). To fix this, I need to replace the problematic division with a safe expression that returns 0 when `n_class` is 1 or less. Since sed is not handling the replacement correctly with the current syntax, I will use a direct string replacement that targets the exact problematic expression. The correct fix is to replace `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)` with `0` to avoid division by zero.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '291s/dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)/0/' /testbed/sklearn/svm/base.py\n```\n",
