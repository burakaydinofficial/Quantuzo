When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing.
