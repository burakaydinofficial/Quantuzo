The current implementation attempts to solve a linear system of equations using `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`, but it fails to validate whether the target units are compatible with the source expression's dimensions. Specifically, when converting `joule*second` to `joule`, the function does not recognize that `joule` and `second` are orthogonal units (they have different dimensions), and instead tries to find a scalar exponent that satisfies a dimensionally inconsistent equation.\n\nThe key issue is in the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function, which checks if the expression's dimensions are a subset of the target units' dimensions.
