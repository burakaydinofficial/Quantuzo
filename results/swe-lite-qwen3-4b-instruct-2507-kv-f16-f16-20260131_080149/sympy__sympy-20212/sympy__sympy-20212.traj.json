Since the table indicates that `0**-oo` should return `zoo`, I need to modify the code to ensure that this case is properly handled. The most likely location is in the `_eval_power` method or a related function that evaluates power expressions. I will now check the `_eval_power` method in `power.py` to see if there's a specific condition that handles `0**-oo`.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/sympy/core/power.py | grep -A 10 -B 5 \"_eval_power\"\n```",
