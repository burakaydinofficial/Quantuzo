The function currently uses `DjangoJSONEncoder` as a hardcoded encoder for JSON serialization. To meet the PR's requirement, I need to modify the function to accept an optional `encoder` parameter that allows users to pass a custom JSON encoder class. I will update the function signature and modify the JSON serialization line to use the provided encoder if one is passed, otherwise default to `DjangoJSONEncoder`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/from django.core.serializers.json import DjangoJSONEncoder/from django.core.serializers.json import DjangoJSONEncoder\\n    def json_script(value, element_id=None, encoder=None):\\n        if encoder is None:\\n            encoder = DjangoJSONEncoder/g' django/utils/html.py\n```\n\nThis change adds the `encoder` parameter and sets a default value of `DjangoJSONEncoder` if no encoder is provided. The function will now allow users to pass a custom encoder class, fulfilling the PR's requirement. I will now verify that the changes have been applied correctly.\n\n```bash\ncat django/utils/html.py | grep -A 5 -B 5 \"json_script\"\n```",
