Since SymPy's matrix module is likely structured with submodules, I should check for the presence of a `matrix.py` file in the `sympy/matrices/` directory. This is a more general location where matrix operations are typically defined. I will now search for the matrix implementation file in the `sympy/matrices/` directory to locate the correct file containing the `col_insert` method.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed/sympy/sympy/matrices/ -type f -name \"matrix*.py\"\n```",
