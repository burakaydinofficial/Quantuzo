      "content": "THOUGHT: The code in `fixtures.py` shows that fixture scope is handled through the `scope` parameter in the `fixture` decorator and is stored in the `FixtureDef` class. The `scope` attribute is used in various parts of the code, such as in `get_scope_node`, `add_funcarg_pseudo_fixture_def`, and `FixtureDef`. However, there is no visible mechanism to display fixture scopes when running `pytest --fixtures`. To implement the PR requirement, we need to modify the fixture display logic to show the scope of each fixture when `--fixtures` is used. The most likely place to add this functionality is in the fixture collection or display logic, possibly in a plugin or a core command. Since the PR description is about displaying fixture scope, and the current implementation does not show scope, I need to identify where the fixture listing occurs. The `pytest` command-line interface likely uses a plugin to list fixtures, and the `--fixtures` option is likely handled in a plugin. I will now search for files related to the pytest command-line interface or fixture listing.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed -type f -name \"cli.py\" -o -name \"plugin.py\" | xargs ls -la\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The code in `fixtures.py` shows that fixture scope is handled through the `scope` parameter in the `fixture` decorator and is stored in the `FixtureDef` class. The `scope` attribute is used in various parts of the code, such as in `get_scope_node`, `add_funcarg_pseudo_fixture_def`, and `FixtureDef`. However, there is no visible mechanism to display fixture scopes when running `pytest --fixtures`. To implement the PR requirement, we need to modify the fixture display logic to show the scope of each fixture when `--fixtures` is used. The most likely place to add this functionality is in the fixture collection or display logic, possibly in a plugin or a core command. Since the PR description is about displaying fixture scope, and the current implementation does not show scope, I need to identify where the fixture listing occurs. The `pytest` command-line interface likely uses a plugin to list fixtures, and the `--fixtures` option is likely handled in a plugin. I will now search for files related to the pytest command-line interface or fixture listing.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed -type f -name \"cli.py\" -o -name \"plugin.py\" | xargs ls -la\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT: The output of `pytest --fixtures` shows that fixture definitions are listed, but without their scopes. This confirms that the current implementation does not display fixture scopes. The fixture scope information is available in the `FixtureDef` class in `fixtures.py`, but it is not being displayed in the output. To fix this, I need to modify the fixture listing logic in the terminal output to include the scope of each fixture. Since the fixture scope is already stored in the `FixtureDef` class, I will now modify the fixture listing functionality in the terminal output to include the scope. The most likely location for this is in the `terminal.py` file, where fixture listing is likely handled. I will now add a patch to include the scope in the fixture listing output.\n\n```bash\ncat > /testbed/src/_pytest/terminal.py << 'EOL'\n# This is a modified version of terminal.py to include fixture

                "content": "THOUGHT: The output of `pytest --fixtures` shows that fixture definitions are listed, but without their scopes. This confirms that the current implementation does not display fixture scopes. The fixture scope information is available in the `FixtureDef` class in `fixtures.py`, but it is not being displayed in the output. To fix this, I need to modify the fixture listing logic in the terminal output to include the scope of each fixture. Since the fixture scope is already stored in the `FixtureDef` class, I will now modify the fixture listing functionality in the terminal output to include the scope. The most likely location for this is in the `terminal.py` file, where fixture listing is likely handled. I will now add a patch to include the scope in the fixture listing output.\n\n```bash\ncat > /testbed/src/_pytest/terminal.py << 'EOL'\n# This is a modified version of terminal.py to include fixture
