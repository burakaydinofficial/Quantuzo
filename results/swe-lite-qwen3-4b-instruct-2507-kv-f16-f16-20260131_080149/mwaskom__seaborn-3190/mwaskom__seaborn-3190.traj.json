                "content": "THOUGHT: The modification has been successfully applied to the ContinuousBase._setup method in scales.py. The code now includes a check for boolean data types and raises a meaningful error message when boolean data is passed to a continuous scale. This prevents the TypeError that occurs when attempting to perform boolean subtraction operations. The fix is general and consistent with the codebase's design, as it properly handles the case where boolean data is used in color mapping by rejecting it with a clear error message. The change ensures that users are informed when they attempt to use boolean data in continuous scales, which is the correct behavior.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
