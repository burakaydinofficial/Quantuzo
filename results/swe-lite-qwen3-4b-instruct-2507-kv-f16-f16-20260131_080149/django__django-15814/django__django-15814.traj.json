The one in `./django/db/models/sql/query.py` is more likely to contain the specific logic related to query execution and related populators, as it is in the `sql/query.py` subdirectory. The PR description references a specific line in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` (line 745), which confirms this is the correct file. I will now examine the content of this file to locate the exact line where the issue occurs and ensure that the fix is properly implemented.\n\n```bash\ncat ./django/db/models/sql/query.py | grep -A 5 -B 5 \"get_related_populators\"\n```",
