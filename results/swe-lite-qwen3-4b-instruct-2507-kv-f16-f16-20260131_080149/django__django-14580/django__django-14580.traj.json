Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\nExample of an INCORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

      "content": "THOUGHT: After examining the `MigrationWriter` class, I can see that the issue lies in how the imports are being managed. The code currently adds an import for `migrations` and `models` only if the `models` import is explicitly present. However, when `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter of the migration class, the `models` import is not being added, even though it is required.\n\nThe key section in the code is in the `as_string` method, where it checks for the presence of `from django.db import models` and adds `from django.db import migrations, models` if it exists. However, if `models` is not already imported, it only adds `from django.db import migrations`. This means that when `models.Model` is used in the `bases` parameter, the `models` import is missing.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that the `models` import is always added when `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter. The current logic only adds the import if `from django.db import models` is already present. I will modify the code to always include the `models` import when `models.Model` is used in the `bases` parameter.\n\nI will edit the `MigrationWriter` class to ensure that the `models` import is added in all cases where `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if \"from django.db import models\" in imports:|if \"from django.db import models\" in imports or \"models\" in [b for b in self.migration.bases if isinstance(b, type) and b.__module__ == \"django.db.models\"]|g' django/db/migrations/writer.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the condition to check if either the `models` import is already present or if `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter. This ensures that the `models` import is always added when needed.\n\nHowever, this approach may not be sufficient because the `bases` parameter is not being directly accessed in the code. I need to ensure that the `models` import is added when `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter. I will now check if there is a more direct way to access the `bases` parameter in the code.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"bases\" django/db/migrations/writer.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: After examining the `MigrationWriter` class, I can see that the issue lies in how the imports are being managed. The code currently adds an import for `migrations` and `models` only if the `models` import is explicitly present. However, when `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter of the migration class, the `models` import is not being added, even though it is required.\n\nThe key section in the code is in the `as_string` method, where it checks for the presence of `from django.db import models` and adds `from django.db import migrations, models` if it exists. However, if `models` is not already imported, it only adds `from django.db import migrations`. This means that when `models.Model` is used in the `bases` parameter, the `models` import is missing.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that the `models` import is always added when `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter. The current logic only adds the import if `from django.db import models` is already present. I will modify the code to always include the `models` import when `models.Model` is used in the `bases` parameter.\n\nI will edit the `MigrationWriter` class to ensure that the `models` import is added in all cases where `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if \"from django.db import models\" in imports:|if \"from django.db import models\" in imports or \"models\" in [b for b in self.migration.bases if isinstance(b, type) and b.__module__ == \"django.db.models\"]|g' django/db/migrations/writer.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the condition to check if either the `models` import is already present or if `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter. This ensures that the `models` import is always added when needed.\n\nHowever, this approach may not be sufficient because the `bases` parameter is not being directly accessed in the code. I need to ensure that the `models` import is added when `models.Model` is referenced in the `bases` parameter. I will now check if there is a more direct way to access the `bases` parameter in the code.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"bases\" django/db/migrations/writer.py\n```",
