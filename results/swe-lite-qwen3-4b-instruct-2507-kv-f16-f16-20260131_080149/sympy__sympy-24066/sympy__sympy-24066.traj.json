The issue described in the PR arises in the `Pow` case, specifically when handling exponentials. The current implementation incorrectly handles the dimensionality of expressions like `exp(expr)` because it does not recognize that the exponent of an exponential function must be dimensionless. \n\nIn the current code, when `expr` is an exponential (`Pow` with base `exp`), the method computes the dimension as `dim ** (exp_factor * exp_dim)`, which incorrectly propagates the dimension of the exponent. However, by mathematical principle, `exp(x)` where `x` is a physical quantity with dimension `D` should result in a dimensionless output only if `x` is dimensionless. The method should recognize that any exponentiation involving `exp` must have a dimensionless exponent.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the `Pow` case in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to handle exponential functions specially. Specifically, if the base is `exp`, then the exponent must be dimensionless, and the resulting dimension should be `Dimension(1)` regardless of the exponent's dimension.\n\nI will now edit the file to add a special case for `exp` in the `Pow` block.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/class Unitsystem/,/def get_units_non_prefixed/ {\n    s/    if isinstance(expr, Pow):/    if isinstance(expr, Pow):\n        &/g\n        s/            if self.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(exp_dim):\n                exp_dim = 1/            if self.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(exp_dim):\n                exp_dim = 1\n                elif expr.base == exp:\n                    return factor, Dimension(1)/g\n}' /testbed/sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py\n```\n\nThis change ensures that when the base of a power is `exp`, the resulting dimension is dimensionless, regardless of the exponent's dimension. This matches the physical principle that `exp(x)` is dimensionless when `x` is a physical quantity.\n\nNote: The above sed command is a simplified version. A more robust fix would require ensuring that `exp` is recognized as a function and that the exponent is dimensionless.
