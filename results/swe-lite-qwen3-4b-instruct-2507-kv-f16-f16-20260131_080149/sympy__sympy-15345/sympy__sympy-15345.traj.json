Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

It is intended for easy and quick\nexperimentation with SymPy.  isympy is a good way to use SymPy as an\ninteractive calculator. If you have IPython and Matplotlib installed, then\ninteractive plotting is enabled by default.\n\nCOMMAND LINE OPTIONS\n--------------------\n\n-c CONSOLE, --console=CONSOLE\n\n     Use the specified shell (Python or IPython) shell as the console\n     backend instead of the default one (IPython if present, Python\n     otherwise), e.g.:\n\n        $isympy -c python\n\n    CONSOLE must be one of 'ipython' or 'python'\n\n-p PRETTY, --pretty PRETTY\n\n    Setup pretty-printing in SymPy. When pretty-printing is enabled,\n    expressions can be printed with Unicode or ASCII. The default is\n    to use pretty-printing (with Unicode if the terminal supports it).\n    When this option is 'no', expressions will not be pretty-printed\n    and ASCII will be used:\n\n        $isympy -p no\n\n    PRETTY must be one of 'unicode', 'ascii', or 'no'\n\n-t TYPES, --types=TYPES\n\n    Setup the ground types for the polys.  By default, gmpy ground types\n    are used if gmpy2 or gmpy is installed, otherwise it falls back to python\n    ground types, which are a little bit slower.  You can manually\n    choose python ground types even if gmpy is installed (e.g., for\n    testing purposes):\n\n        $isympy -t python\n\n    TYPES must be one of 'gmpy', 'gmpy1' or 'python'\n\n    Note that the ground type gmpy1 is primarily intended for testing; it\n    forces the use of gmpy version 1 even if gmpy2 is available.\n\n    This is the same as setting the environment variable\n    SYMPY_GROUND_TYPES to the given ground type (e.g.,\n    SYMPY_GROUND_TYPES='gmpy')\n\n    The ground types can be determined interactively from the variable\n    sympy.polys.domains.GROUND_TYPES.\n\n-o ORDER, --order ORDER\n\n    Setup the ordering of terms for printing.  The default is lex, which\n    orders terms lexicographically (e.g., x**2 + x + 1). You can choose\n    other orderings, such as rev-lex, which will use reverse\n    lexicographic ordering (e.g., 1 + x + x**2):\n\n        $isympy -o rev-lex\n\n    ORDER must be one of 'lex', 'rev-lex', 'grlex', 'rev-grlex',\n    'grevlex', 'rev-grevlex', 'old', or 'none'.\n\n    Note that for very large expressions, ORDER='none' may speed up\n    printing considerably but the terms will have no canonical order.\n\n-q, --quiet\n\n    Print only Python's and SymPy's versions to stdout at startup.\n\n-d, --doctest\n\n    Use the same format that should be used for doctests.  This is\n    equivalent to -c python -p no.\n\n-C, --no-cache\n\n    Disable the caching mechanism.  Disabling the cache may slow certain\n    operations down considerably.  This is useful for testing the cache,\n    or for benchmarking, as the cache can result in deceptive timings.\n\n    This is equivalent to setting the environment variable\n    SYMPY_USE_CACHE to 'no'.\n\n-a, --auto-symbols (requires at least IPython 0.11)\n\n    Automatically create missing symbols.  Normally, typing a name of a\n    Symbol that has not been instantiated first would raise NameError,\n    but with this option enabled, any undefined name will be\n    automatically created as a Symbol.\n\n    Note that this is intended only for interactive, calculator style\n    usage. In a script that uses SymPy, Symbols should be instantiated\n    at the top, so that it's clear what they are.\n\n    This will not override any names that are already defined, which\n    includes the single character letters represented by the mnemonic\n    QCOSINE (see the \"Gotchas and Pitfalls\" document in the\n    documentation). You can delete existing names by executing \"del\n    name\".  If a name is defined, typing \"'name' in dir()\" will return True.\n\n    The Symbols that are created using this have default assumptions.\n    If you want to place assumptions on symbols, you should create them\n    using symbols() or var().\n\n    Finally, this only works in the top level namespace. So, for\n    example, if you define a function in isympy with an undefined\n    Symbol, it will not work.\n\n    See also the -i and -I options.\n\n-i, --int-to-Integer (requires at least IPython 0.11)\n\n    Automatically wrap int literals with Integer.  This makes it so that\n    things like 1/2 will come out as Rational(1, 2), rather than 0.5.  This\n    works by preprocessing the source and wrapping all int literals with\n    Integer.  Note that this will not change the behavior of int literals\n    assigned to variables, and it also won't change the behavior of functions\n    th\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n1199 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\nes\n# by the command line will break.\n\ndef main():\n    from argparse import ArgumentParser, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter\n\n    VERSION = None\n    if '--version' in sys.argv:\n        # We cannot import sympy before this is run, because flags like -C and\n        # -t set environment variables that must be set before SymPy is\n        # imported.
