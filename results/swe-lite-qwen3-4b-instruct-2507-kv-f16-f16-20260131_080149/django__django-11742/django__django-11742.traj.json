Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `CharField` class is defined in `/testbed/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, and it already has a `check` method that validates the `max_length` attribute. However, there is no check to ensure that `max_length` is large enough to fit the longest value in `choices`. To implement the required validation, I will add a check in the `check` method of `CharField` that evaluates the longest value in `choices` and ensures it does not exceed `max_length`. This check should be added after the existing `max_length` validation and before the end of the `check` method.\n\nI will now modify the `CharField` class to include this validation logic.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/class CharField/ a\\\\    if self.choices and self.max_length:\\\\\n\\\\        max_choice_length = max(len(str(choice)) for choice, _ in self.choices)\\\\\n\\\\        if max_choice_length > self.max_length:\\\\\n\\\\            return [\\\\\n\\\\                checks.Error(\\\\\n\\\\                    f\"max_length ({self.max_length}) is too small to fit the longest choice value (length {max_choice_length}).\",\\\\\n\\\\                    obj=self,\\\\\n\\\\                    id=\\\"fields.E121\\\",\\\\\n\\\\                )\\\\\n\\\\            ]\\\\\n\\\\        ' /testbed/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\n```\n\nThis command adds a new check to ensure that `max_length` is sufficient to hold the longest value in `choices`. It calculates the length of the longest choice value and compares it to `max_length`, raising an error if it exceeds the limit.\n\nAfter this change, the PR requirement will be satisfied, and the validation will be in place for `CharField` instances with `choices`. The error message will clearly indicate the issue, making it easier for developers to fix it.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
