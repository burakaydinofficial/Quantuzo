Alternatively, the\n        dictionary value can be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test,\n        cfunction_string)].

If an\n    ``assign_to`` variable is provided an if statement is created, otherwise\n    the ternary operator is used. Note that if the ``Piecewise`` lacks a\n    default term, represented by ``(expr, True)`` then an error will be thrown.\n    This is to prevent generating an expression that may not evaluate to\n    anything.\n\n    >>> from sympy import Piecewise\n    >>> expr = Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True))\n    >>> print(ccode(expr, tau))\n    if (x > 0) {\n    tau = x + 1;\n    }\n    else {\n    tau = x;\n    }\n\n    Support for loops is provided through ``Indexed`` types. With\n    ``contract=True`` these expressions will be turned into loops, whereas\n    ``contract=False`` will just print the assignment expression that should be\n    looped over:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Eq, IndexedBase, Idx\n    >>> len_y = 5\n    >>> y = IndexedBase('y', shape=(len_y,))\n    >>> t = IndexedBase('t', shape=(len_y,))\n    >>> Dy = IndexedBase('Dy', shape=(len_y-1,))\n    >>> i = Idx('i', len_y-1)\n    >>> e=Eq(Dy[i], (y[i+1]-y[i])/(t[i+1]-t[i]))\n    >>> ccode(e.rhs, assign_to=e.lhs, contract=False)\n    'Dy[i] = (y[i + 1] - y[i])/(t[i + 1] - t[i]);'\n\n    Matrices are also supported, but a ``MatrixSymbol`` of the same dimensions\n    must be provided to ``assign_to``. Note that any expression that can be\n    generated normally can also exist inside a Matrix:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Matrix, MatrixSymbol\n    >>> mat = Matrix([x**2, Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True)), sin(x)])\n    >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 3, 1)\n    >>> print(ccode(mat, A))\n    A[0] = pow(x, 2);\n    if (x > 0) {\n       A[1] = x + 1;\n    }\n    else {\n       A[1] = x;\n    }\n    A[2] = sin(x);\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return CCodePrinter(settings).doprint(expr, assign_to)\n\n\ndef print_ccode(expr, **settings):\n    \"\"\"Prints C representation of the given expression.\"\"\"\n    print(ccode(expr, **settings))\n\n</output_tail>",

Instead, it is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of tuples, with the first element being a condition and the second being the C function name. For example, `Abs` is defined as `[(lambda x: not x.is_integer, \"fabs\")]`. To correctly add the `sinc` function, I need to define it in the same format, mapping it to `sin(x)/x`. I will now update the `known_functions` dictionary to include the `sinc` function with the correct format.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/known_functions = {/known_functions = {\\n    \"sinc\": [(lambda x: True, \"sin(x)/x\")],/g' /testbed/sympy/printing/ccode.py\n```\n",
