Since the PR description refers to Django code and the issue is in a form widget, I should look for a file that contains the `create_option` method in a Django forms widget. A common location for such code is in `django/forms/widgets.py`. I will check if this file exists in the current directory or in a subdirectory. If it doesn't exist, the issue might be in a different part of the codebase, but given the context, this is the most likely location.\n\n```bash\nls -la | grep -E \"widgets.py|form.py\"\n```",
