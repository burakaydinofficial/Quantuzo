Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

Given that the PR description refers to a `Matrix` class and its `@` operator, it is likely that the implementation resides in a file named `matrix.py` or a similar file within the codebase. Since we cannot see the full codebase, I will assume that the `__matmul__` method is defined in a file that handles matrix operations, and the most plausible candidate is `matrix.py`. If it's not there, the file might be in a subdirectory. However, without further directory structure, I will proceed with a direct edit to the most likely file, `matrix.py`, assuming it exists in the current directory, and if not, the fix will be applied in a way that is consistent with the PR description.\n\nSince no file was found, I will create a minimal test script to reproduce the issue and verify the behavior, then modify the source code accordingly.
