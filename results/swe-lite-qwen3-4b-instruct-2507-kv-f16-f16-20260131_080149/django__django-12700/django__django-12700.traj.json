Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

The function currently only recursively processes dictionaries using a dictionary comprehension. It does not handle other iterable types like lists or tuples. To fix the issue described in the PR, I need to modify `cleanse_setting` to recursively cleanse all iterable types (lists, tuples, etc.) by applying the same cleansing logic to their contents.\n\nThe current implementation only handles `dict` types, and the PR example shows that nested lists containing sensitive values (like \"secret\" or \"token\") are not sanitized. I will update the function to recursively process any iterable (list, tuple, etc.) by iterating over its contents and applying `cleanse_setting` to each element.\n\nI will now modify the `cleanse_setting` function to handle iterables recursively.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/                cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}/                if isinstance(value, (dict, list, tuple)):                    cleansed = type(value)(self.cleanse_setting(k, v) if isinstance(v, dict) else v for v in value) if isinstance(value, (list, tuple)) else {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()} else value/g' /testbed/django/views/debug.py\n```\n\nWait \u2014 this sed command is overly complex and may not correctly handle nested structures. Instead, I should carefully rewrite the function to properly handle all iterables.

The current implementation only processes dictionaries. I will modify the function to process lists and tuples by recursively applying `cleanse_setting` to their elements, but only when the element is a dictionary or string. This ensures that nested structures containing sensitive values (like \"secret\", \"token\") are properly masked.\n\nI will use a precise sed command to replace the existing dictionary-only handling with a version that handles both dictionaries and iterables.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/                cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}/                if isinstance(value, dict):                    cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}                elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):                    cleansed = [self.cleanse_setting(key, item) if isinstance(item, (dict, str)) else item for item in value]                else:                    cleansed = value/g' /testbed/django/views/debug.py\n```",
