This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The previous `sed` command modified the `ErrorList` class initialization to include a `nonform_css_class` parameter, but it did not fully implement the actual rendering of the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors. The PR description implies that non-form errors should be rendered with a `nonform` CSS class, similar to how non-field errors are rendered with a `nonfield` class in forms. The `ErrorList` class in `formsets.py` needs to be updated to apply the `nonform` class to non-form errors during rendering. I need to locate the error rendering logic in the `BaseFormSet` class and ensure that non-form errors are properly styled. The `BaseFormSet` class already has a `_non_form_errors` attribute, which stores non-form errors. I will now modify the `as_table`, `as_p`, and `as_ul` methods in `BaseFormSet` to apply the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def as_table(self):/def as_table(self):\\n
