It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error. If you remove .set_output(transform=\"pandas\") on the line before last, all works fine. If you remove the (\"categorical\", ...) step, it works fine too.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.compose import
