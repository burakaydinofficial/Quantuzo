The change ensures that trailing slashes are stripped before calling `basename()` when validating the app directory name. This resolves the issue where `django-admin startapp` would fail when a directory name includes a trailing slash.\n\nThe task is now complete, and I will submit the final changes.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
