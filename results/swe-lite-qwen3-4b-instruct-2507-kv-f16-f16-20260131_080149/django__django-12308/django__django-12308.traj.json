      "content": "THOUGHT: The `JSONField` class in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` defines the `get_prep_value` method, which is responsible for converting values to JSON strings before database storage. However, the PR description specifically points to a problem in the admin interface where JSONField values are displayed as Python dictionaries when readonly. This suggests that the issue is not in the field's storage or validation, but in how values are displayed in the admin interface.\n\nThe PR description recommends modifying `django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field` to call the `prepare_value` method of the JSONField instead of directly using `json.dumps`. However, I have not found any `prepare_value` method in the JSONField class. The `prepare_value` method is typically used in Django model fields to prepare values for display or serialization. Since the `JSONField` class does not have a `prepare_value` method, and the PR description suggests that the fix should involve calling `prepare_value`, I suspect that the `prepare_value` method might be defined in a different part of the codebase or that the PR is referring to a different method.\n\nGiven that the PR description specifically mentions `prepare_value` and that the issue is in the admin interface, I need to check if there is a `prepare_value` method in the `JSONField` class or if it is defined elsewhere. Since the `JSONField` class does not have a `prepare_value` method, and the PR description suggests that the fix should involve calling `prepare_value`, I will now check if there is a `prepare_value` method in the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file, which is where `display_for_field` is defined.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"prepare_value\" django/\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `JSONField` class in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` defines the `get_prep_value` method, which is responsible for converting values to JSON strings before database storage. However, the PR description specifically points to a problem in the admin interface where JSONField values are displayed as Python dictionaries when readonly. This suggests that the issue is not in the field's storage or validation, but in how values are displayed in the admin interface.\n\nThe PR description recommends modifying `django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field` to call the `prepare_value` method of the JSONField instead of directly using `json.dumps`. However, I have not found any `prepare_value` method in the JSONField class. The `prepare_value` method is typically used in Django model fields to prepare values for display or serialization. Since the `JSONField` class does not have a `prepare_value` method, and the PR description suggests that the fix should involve calling `prepare_value`, I suspect that the `prepare_value` method might be defined in a different part of the codebase or that the PR is referring to a different method.\n\nGiven that the PR description specifically mentions `prepare_value` and that the issue is in the admin interface, I need to check if there is a `prepare_value` method in the `JSONField` class or if it is defined elsewhere. Since the `JSONField` class does not have a `prepare_value` method, and the PR description suggests that the fix should involve calling `prepare_value`, I will now check if there is a `prepare_value` method in the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file, which is where `display_for_field` is defined.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"prepare_value\" django/\n```",
