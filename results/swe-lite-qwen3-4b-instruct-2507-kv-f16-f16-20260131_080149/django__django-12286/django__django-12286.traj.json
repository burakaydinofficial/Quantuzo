To fix this, I need to locate the Django source code that validates the LANGUAGE_CODE against the LANGUAGES setting and modify it to allow fallback to base languages. The most likely file is in Django's core translation module, probably `django/conf/global_settings.py` or `django/utils/translation/__init__.py`. I will first check the structure of the codebase to locate the relevant file.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed -type f -name \"*.py\" -exec grep -l \"LANGUAGE_CODE\" {} \\;\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT: The `check_language_settings_consistent` function in `translation.py` is responsible for raising E004 when `LANGUAGE_CODE` is not in the `LANGUAGES` setting. The current logic strictly requires that `LANGUAGE_CODE` must be present in the `LANGUAGES` setting, which is inconsistent with Django's behavior where a sublanguage (like \"de-at\") should fall back to the base language (\"de\") if the sublanguage is not available. To fix this, I need to modify the function to allow fallback to base languages. The current `available_tags` set includes only the language codes from `LANGUAGES` and explicitly adds \"en-us\", but it does not include base languages as fallbacks. I will update the function to check if the base language (e.g., \"de\" for \"de-at\") is available in `LANGUAGES` when the sublanguage is not. This change will ensure that E004 is not raised when a base language exists even if the sublanguage is not.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} |available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} |g' /testbed/django/core/checks/translation.py\n```\n\nWait, this does not modify the logic. I need to actually update the function to check for base languages. The current code does not check for base languages. I need to modify it to check if the base language exists in `LANGUAGES` when the sublanguage is not. I will now update the function to include base language checks.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if settings.LANGUAGE_CODE not in available_tags:|if not (settings.LANGUAGE_CODE in available_tags or any(tag == settings.LANGUAGE_CODE.split(\"-\")[0] for tag in available_tags)):\\\\\\    return [E004]\\\\    return []|g' /testbed/django/core/checks/translation.py\n```\n\nThis is incorrect.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `check_language_settings_consistent` function in `translation.py` is responsible for raising E004 when `LANGUAGE_CODE` is not in the `LANGUAGES` setting. The current logic strictly requires that `LANGUAGE_CODE` must be present in the `LANGUAGES` setting, which is inconsistent with Django's behavior where a sublanguage (like \"de-at\") should fall back to the base language (\"de\") if the sublanguage is not available. To fix this, I need to modify the function to allow fallback to base languages. The current `available_tags` set includes only the language codes from `LANGUAGES` and explicitly adds \"en-us\", but it does not include base languages as fallbacks. I will update the function to check if the base language (e.g., \"de\" for \"de-at\") is available in `LANGUAGES` when the sublanguage is not. This change will ensure that E004 is not raised when a base language exists even if the sublanguage is not.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} |available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} |g' /testbed/django/core/checks/translation.py\n```\n\nWait, this does not modify the logic. I need to actually update the function to check for base languages. The current code does not check for base languages. I need to modify it to check if the base language exists in `LANGUAGES` when the sublanguage is not. I will now update the function to include base language checks.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if settings.LANGUAGE_CODE not in available_tags:|if not (settings.LANGUAGE_CODE in available_tags or any(tag == settings.LANGUAGE_CODE.split(\"-\")[0] for tag in available_tags)):\\\\\\    return [E004]\\\\    return []|g' /testbed/django/core/checks/translation.py\n```\n\nThis is incorrect. I need to properly check for base languages. Let me fix this.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if settings.LANGUAGE_CODE not in available_tags:|if not (settings.LANGUAGE_CODE in available_tags or any(tag.split(\"-\")[0] == settings.LANGUAGE_CODE.split(\"-\")[0] for tag in available_tags)):\\\\\\    return [E004]\\\\    return []|g' /testbed/django/core/checks/translation.py\n```\n\nThis is still not correct.
