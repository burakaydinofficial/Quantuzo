The function currently has a parameter `discrete_features='auto'`, and the issue is that it compares `discrete_features == 'auto'` directly, which will fail if `discrete_features` is an array or boolean mask. To fix this, I need to modify the function to handle both string and array/boolean inputs. The fix should check the type of `discrete_features` and handle it appropriately. I will now update the function to first check if `discrete_features` is a string, and if not, treat it as an array or boolean mask.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/discrete_features=\\'auto\\'/discrete_features = discrete_features if not isinstance(discrete_features, str) else \\'auto\\'/' /testbed/sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py\n```\n\nThis change ensures that if `discrete_features` is not a string, it is treated as an array or boolean mask, avoiding the comparison with a string. This makes the code more robust and compatible with future versions of numpy.\n\nNote: The above sed command assumes that the comparison is directly using `discrete_features == 'auto'`. If the actual comparison is in a different context, further adjustments may be needed. However, based on the PR description, this is a reasonable fix to prevent the error.\n\nAfter this change, I will verify that the function works correctly by checking the updated file content.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py | grep -A 5 -B 5 \"discrete_features\"\n```",
