Handle `Eq` objects by extracting the left-hand side and right-hand side and treating them as expressions.\n2. Support expressions where the dependent variable is written as `f(x)` by replacing `f(x)` with a symbolic expression and then differentiating.\n\nThe key changes needed are:\n- Check if the input `eq` is an `Eq` object and handle it by extracting the expressions.\n- Replace any occurrence of `f(x)` or similar function expressions with a symbolic variable (e.g., `y`) and then proceed with differentiation.\n\nI will now modify the `idiff` function to support both cases by adding appropriate checks and substitutions.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def idiff(eq, y, x, n=1):/def idiff(eq, y, x, n=1):\\n    # Handle Eq objects\\n    if isinstance(eq, Eq):\\n        eq = eq.lhs - eq.rhs\\n    # Handle f(x) by replacing f(x) with a symbol\\n    if isinstance(y, sympy.Function):\\n        y = y(x)\\n    # Proceed with differentiation as before/' sympy/geometry/util.py\n```\n",

The function `idiff` is designed to work with symbolic expressions, and the substitution of `f(x)` with `y` must be done correctly using SymPy's function and symbol handling. However, the current implementation does not properly handle function substitutions, and the syntax errors prevent the changes from being applied correctly.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I realize that the function `idiff` already has a mechanism to handle `f(x)` by checking if `y` is a `sympy.Function` and substituting `y(x)`. The issue is that it does not handle expressions where `f(x)` appears in the input equation. To fix this, I need to ensure that any occurrence of a function of `x` (like `f(x)`) is replaced with `y` in the expression before differentiation. This requires a proper substitution step that uses SymPy's expression manipulation.\n\nI will now update the function to properly substitute any function of `x` with `y` in the expression before differentiation.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def idiff(eq, y, x, n=1):/def idiff(eq, y, x, n=1):\\n    # Handle Eq objects\\n    if isinstance(eq, Eq):\\n        eq = eq.lhs - eq.rhs\\n    # Handle f(x) or any function of x by replacing with a symbol\\n    if isinstance(y, sympy.Function):\\n        y = y(x)\\n    # Substitute any function of x in the expression with y\\n    if isinstance(eq, sympy.Expr):\\n        eq = eq.subs(sympy.Function(x), y)\\n    # Proceed with differentiation as before/' sympy/geometry/util.py\n```\n",
