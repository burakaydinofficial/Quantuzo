Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The output shows that `standard_transformations` includes several transformations like `lambda_notation`, `auto_symbol`, `repeated_decimals`, `auto_number`, and `implicit_multiplication`. However, there is no explicit transformation for handling `Point2D` expressions. This suggests that the issue is not due to a transformation evaluating `Point2D` arguments, but rather in how the `evaluate=False` context is being passed to the `Point2D` constructor during parsing.\n\nThe key insight is that the `Point2D` constructor itself supports `evaluate=False` as a parameter, as shown in the `point.py` output. The error occurs when `evaluate=False` is used in a context block (`with evaluate(False):`), and the `Point2D` constructor is invoked with arguments that are being evaluated during parsing.\n\nThe issue is likely in how the `sympify` function or `parse_expr` handles the `evaluate=False` context when parsing expressions like `'Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))'`. The parser may be attempting to evaluate the `Integer(1)` and `Integer(2)` objects during parsing, even when `evaluate=False` is specified.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when `evaluate=False` is passed, the `Point2D` constructor receives the arguments in their un-evaluated form. This can be achieved by modifying the `sympin` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` to avoid evaluating the arguments when constructing `Point2D` objects.\n\nSpecifically, I need to modify the `sympify` function to ensure that when `evaluate=False` is passed, the arguments to `Point2D` are not evaluated. This can be done by ensuring that the `Point2D` constructor is called with the arguments in their original form, without attempting to evaluate them.\n\nI will now check if there is a specific handling in the `sympify` function that evaluates arguments to `Point2D` objects.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"Point2D\" /testbed/sympy/core/sympify.py\n```",
