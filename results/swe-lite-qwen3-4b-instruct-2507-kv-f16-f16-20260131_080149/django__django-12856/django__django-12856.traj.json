The code assumes that the fields exist when creating the constraint, but it does not validate that the fields are actually defined in the model. This is the core issue described in the PR. To fix this, we need to ensure that when a UniqueConstraint is defined, the fields referenced in it exist in the model. This validation should happen during model definition or when the model is processed. Since the PR description mentions that the older `unique_together` syntax raises E012 if fields don't exist, we should implement a similar check for `UniqueConstraint`. The most appropriate place to add this validation is in the model validation logic, likely in `django/db/models/base.py` or in a model check function.

To fix this, we need to add a check in the model validation system to ensure that the fields referenced in a UniqueConstraint exist in the model. The most appropriate place to add this validation is in the `check_all_models` function in `model_checks.py`, where model constraints are validated. I will now modify the `check_all_models` function to include a check for UniqueConstraint fields.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|for model_constraint in model._meta.constraints:|for model_constraint in model._meta.constraints:\\n    if isinstance(model_constraint, UniqueConstraint):\\n        for field_name in model_constraint.fields:\\n            try:\\n                model._meta.get_field(field_name)\\n            except FieldDoesNotExist:\\n                errors.append(\\n                    Error(\\n                        \"UniqueConstraint field '%s' does not exist in model %s.\" % (field_name, model._meta.label),\\n                        obj=model,\\n                        id=\\\"models.E012\\\",\\n                    )\\n                )|' /testbed/django/core/checks/model_checks.py\n```\n",
