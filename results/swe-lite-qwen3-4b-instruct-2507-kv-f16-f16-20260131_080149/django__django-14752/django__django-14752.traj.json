      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nRefactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable?

I need to carefully edit the file to ensure that the `serialize_result` method is properly defined and that the `get()` method correctly uses it.\n\nI will now manually write the correct changes by inserting the `serialize_result` method and updating the `get()` method to use it. The `serialize_result` method should be defined to return a dictionary with the default fields (`id` and `text`) and can be overridden by subclasses. The `get()` method should then use this method to construct the results.\n\n```bash\ncat << 'EOF' > django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldDoesNotExist, PermissionDenied\nfrom django.http import Http404, JsonResponse\nfrom django.views.generic.list import BaseListView\n\n\nclass AutocompleteJsonView(BaseListView):\n    \"\"\"Handle AutocompleteWidget's AJAX requests for data.\"\"\"\n    paginate_by = 20\n    admin_site = None\n\n    def serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n        \"\"\"Default implementation to serialize an autocomplete result.\"\"\"\n        return {\n            'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)),\n            'text': str(obj),\n        }\n\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a JsonResponse with search results of the form:\n        {\n            results: [{id: \"123\" text: \"foo\"}],\n            pagination: {more: true}\n        }\n        \"\"\"\n        self.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\n        if not self.has_perm(request):\n            raise PermissionDenied\n\n        self.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n        context = self.get_context_data()\n        return JsonResponse({\n            \"results\": [\n                self.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context[\"object_list\"]\n            ],\n            \"pagination\": {\"more\": context[\"page_obj\"].has_next()},\n        })\n\n    def get_paginator(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"Use the ModelAdmin's paginator.\"\"\"\n        return self.model_admin.get_paginator(self.request, *args, **kwargs)\n\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        \"\"\"Return queryset based on ModelAdmin.get_search_results().\"\"\"\n        qs = self.model_admin.get_queryset(self.request)\n        qs = qs.complex_filter(self.source_field.get_limit_choices_to())\n        qs, search_use_distinct = self.model_admin.get_search_results(self.request, qs, self.term)\n        if search_use_distinct:\n            qs = qs.distinct()\n        return qs\n\n    def process_request(self, request):\n        \"\"\"\n        Validate request integrity, extract and return request parameters.\n\n        Since the subsequent view permission check requires the target model\n        admin, which is determined here, raise PermissionDenied if the\n        requested app, model or field are malformed.\n\n        Raise Http404 if the target model admin is not configured properly with\n        search_fields.\n        \"\"\"\n        term = request.GET.get('term', '')\n        try:\n            app_label = request.GET['app_label']\n            model_name = request.GET['model_name']\n            field_name = request.GET['field_name']\n        except KeyError as e:\n            raise PermissionDenied from e\n\n        # Retrieve objects from parameters.\n        try:\n            source_model = apps.get_model(app_label, model_name)\n        except LookupError as e:\n            raise PermissionDenied from e\n\n        try:\n            source_field = source_model._meta.get_field(field_name)\n        except FieldDoesNotExist as e:\n            raise PermissionDenied from e\n        try:\n            remote_model = source_field.remote_field.model\n        except AttributeError as e:\n            raise PermissionDenied from e\n        try:\n            model_admin = self.admin_site._registry[remote_model]\n        except KeyError as e:\n            raise PermissionDenied from e\n\n        # Validate suitability of objects.\n        if not model_admin.get_search_fields(request):\n            raise Http404(\n                '%s must have search_fields for the autocomplete_view.' %\n                type(model_admin).__qualname__\n            )\n\n        to_field_name = getattr(source_field.remote_field, 'field_name', remote_model._meta.pk.attname)\n        to_field_name = remote_model._meta.get_field(to_field_name).attname\n        if not model_admin.to_field_allowed(request, to_field_name):\n            raise PermissionDenied\n\n        return term, model_admin, source_field, to_field_name\n\n    def has_perm(self, request, obj=None):\n        \"\"\"Check if user has permission to access the related model.\"\"\"\n        return self.model_admin.has_view_permission(request, obj=obj)\nEOF\n```\n",
