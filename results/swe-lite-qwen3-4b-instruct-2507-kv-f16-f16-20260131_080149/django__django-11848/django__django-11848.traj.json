                "content": "THOUGHT: I need to ensure the modification to `parse_http_date` is accurate and properly implements RFC 7231's requirement. After reviewing the function, I see that the current implementation hardcodes year ranges (0-69 for 2000-2069, 70-99 for 1970-1999), which is incorrect. The fix must adjust the year value when it appears to be more than 50 years in the future by interpreting it as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\nI will now directly edit the function to implement this logic correctly. The key change is to add a condition that checks if the two-digit year, when interpreted as a full year, is more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year, and if so, subtract 100 from the year value.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/    if year < 70:\\\\s*\\\\s*year += 100/    if year < 70:\\\\s*\\\\s*year += 100\\n    elif year > 69 and year - current_year > 50:\\\\s*\\\\s*year -= 100/g' /testbed/django/utils/http.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the function to correctly handle two-digit years by adjusting the year value when it appears to be more than 50 years in the future, ensuring compliance with RFC 7231.\n\nAfter making this change, I will verify that the function now correctly handles two-digit years by checking the updated content.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/django/utils/http.py | grep -A 5 -B 5 \"parse_http_date\"\n```\n\nThis will confirm the fix is in place.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/django/utils/http.py | grep -A 5 -B 5 \"parse_http_date\"\n```",
