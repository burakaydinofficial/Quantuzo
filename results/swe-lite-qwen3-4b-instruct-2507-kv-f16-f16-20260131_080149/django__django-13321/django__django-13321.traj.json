                "content": "THOUGHT: The patch has been successfully applied to the `base.py` file in the Django sessions backend. The modification ensures that when decoding session data fails due to incorrect padding or invalid format, the session decoding gracefully returns an empty dictionary instead of crashing. This prevents the application from crashing on invalid session data, which aligns with the reported issue where Chrome crashes on login attempts due to corrupted session data, while Firefox works fine.\n\nThe change is general and consistent with Django's expected behavior\u2014handling malformed session data without crashing. Since the issue was specific to the staging server and only occurred on Chrome (possibly due to session data corruption), this fix ensures that the application remains stable even when encountering corrupted or invalid session data.\n\nThe fix is now complete and ready for submission.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
