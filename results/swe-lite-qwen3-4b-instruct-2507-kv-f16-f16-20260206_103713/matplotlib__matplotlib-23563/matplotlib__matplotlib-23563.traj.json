When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console.

Additionally, the error 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' suggests a failure in the 3D plotting backend due to invalid input types. The fix is to ensure that the inputs to `ax.plot` are properly typed (numerical arrays) and not strings. I will modify the code to initialize these arrays with proper numerical values instead of strings.\n\n```bash\ncat << 'EOF' > test_plot.py\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Fix: Initialize arrays with proper numerical values\nx_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nx_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\ny_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ny_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\nz_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nz_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\nax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\nax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\nclr_list = 'r-'\n\nfor n in range(len(z_s_0)):\n    ax.plot([x_s_0[n], x_e_0[n]],\n            [y_s_0[n], y_e_0[n]],\n            [z_s_0[n], z_e_0[n]], clr_list)\n\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('90-0')\nplt.show()\nEOF\n```",
