Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The file `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` contains the `MatMul` class, which is responsible for matrix multiplication operations. The `validate` function in this file checks whether the shapes of the matrices are aligned for multiplication. However, the PR description specifies that `@` should fail if one argument is not a matrix, which means the implementation must validate that both operands are matrices before performing multiplication. Currently, the `validate` function only checks alignment between consecutive matrices, but it does not validate that all operands are matrices. I need to modify the `validate` function to ensure that any non-matrix operand raises a proper error.\n\nI will now edit the `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` file to add a check that ensures all operands are matrices before calling `validate`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/def validate/ a\\\\n    if not all(arg.is_Matrix for arg in matrices):\\\\n        raise ValueError(\"One argument is not a matrix\")\\\\n\\\\n    for i in range(len(matrices)-1):\\\\n        A, B = matrices[i:i+2]\\\\n        if A.cols != B.rows:\\\\n            raise ShapeError(\"Matrices %s and %s are not aligned\"%(A, B))' sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the `validate` function to first check if all arguments are matrices, and if not, raise a `ValueError` as specified in the PR description. This ensures that scalar operands (like `2@B`) will fail with an appropriate error message, consistent with NumPy's behavior.\n\nNote: The original `validate` function already checks matrix alignment, so I am adding the matrix type check at the beginning of the function to ensure that non-matrix operands are rejected.
