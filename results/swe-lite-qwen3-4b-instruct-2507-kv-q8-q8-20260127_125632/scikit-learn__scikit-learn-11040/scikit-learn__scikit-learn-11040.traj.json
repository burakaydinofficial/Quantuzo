However, the issue described in the PR is that a float value is being passed to `n_neighbors`, and the code should validate that it is an integer. The current validation only checks for positivity and non-None, not for being an integer. I need to add a check to ensure `n_neighbors` is an integer before proceeding. I will modify the `__init__` method in `base.py` to include this validation.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if self.n_neighbors is not None:\\\\s*\\\\s*if self.n_neighbors <= 0:\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*raise ValueError\\\\s*\\\\(\\\\s*\\\\\\\"Expected n_neighbors >
