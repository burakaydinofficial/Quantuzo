I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
