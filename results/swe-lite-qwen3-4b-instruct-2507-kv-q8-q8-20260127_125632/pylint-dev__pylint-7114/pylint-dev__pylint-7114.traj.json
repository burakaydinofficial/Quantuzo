I now realize that I need to directly replace the entire body of the `get_python_path` function with a minimal, correct version that returns the directory path without any checks for `__init__.py`. The function should simply return `os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(os.path.expanduser(filepath)))`. I will now use a precise sed command to replace the entire function body with this correct implementation.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|    while True:|    return os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(os.path.expanduser(filepath)))|' pylint/lint/expand_modules.py\n```\n",
