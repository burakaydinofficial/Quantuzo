Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
