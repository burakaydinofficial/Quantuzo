The issue arises because these dtypes are converted to object dtype when converted to numpy arrays, leading to a type mismatch error. The solution should ensure that nullable pandas dtypes are handled properly, similar to how non-nullable dtypes are handled.

The issue arises because these dtypes are converted to object dtype when converted to numpy arrays, leading to a type mismatch error. The solution should ensure that nullable pandas dtypes are handled properly, similar to how non-nullable dtypes are handled. I need to locate the source file for `unique_labels` in the scikit-learn codebase. The function is likely in `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py`.
