                "content": "THOUGHT: The persistent failure indicates that the issue is not with the replacement logic but with the syntax of the `sed` command. The problem is that `sed` does not support Python f-strings or dynamic variables like `{self.instance.pk}`. The correct fix requires a direct, precise edit of the file, and since `sed` cannot handle such expressions, I must instead use a different approach. I will now use `cat` and `sed` in a way that ensures the replacement is valid and safe, by replacing only the literal string `../password/` with `../../{self.instance.pk}/password/`, ensuring that the Python syntax remains valid.\n\nI will now perform the replacement with a valid and safe pattern that avoids invalid Python syntax.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/\\.format\\(\"\\.\\.\\/password\\/\"\\)/\\.format\\(\"\\/\\.\\.\\/{self.instance.pk}\\/password\\/\"\\)/g' django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n```",
