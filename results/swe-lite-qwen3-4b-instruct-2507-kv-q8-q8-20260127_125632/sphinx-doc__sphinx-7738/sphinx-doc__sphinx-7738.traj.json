The issue is that the shell is interpreting the command incorrectly because of how the quotes are nested. I need to ensure the entire sed command is properly quoted and escaped. The correct approach is to use a single-quoted string for the sed command and escape the backslashes and quotes appropriately. I will now use a more robust method by wrapping the entire sed command in a single-quoted string and ensuring all backslashes are properly escaped.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/    if name.endswith(\"_\"): name = name[:-1] + r\"\\\\_\"//g' /testbed/sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py\n```",
