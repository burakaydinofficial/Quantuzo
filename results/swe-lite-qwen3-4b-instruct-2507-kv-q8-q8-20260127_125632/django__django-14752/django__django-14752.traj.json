      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nRefactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable?

I need to add the `serialize_result` method with the default behavior to ensure the refactoring is complete and functional. After adding the method, the `get()` method should use it to construct the results list. I will now insert the `serialize_result` method into the class definition.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):/    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        self.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\\n        if not self.has_perm(request):\\n            raise PermissionDenied\\n        self.object_list = self.get_queryset()\\n        context = self.get_context_data()\\n        return JsonResponse({\\n            \\\"results\\\": [\\n                self.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context[\\\"object_list\\\"]\\n            ],\\n            \\\"pagination\\\": {\\\"more\\\": context[\\\"page_obj\\\"].has_next()},\\n        }, safe=False)\\n\\n    def serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\\n        return {\\n            \\\"id\\\": str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)),\\n            \\\"text\\\": str(obj)\\n        }/' django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py\n```\n\nThis command adds the `serialize_result` method to the `AutocompleteJsonView` class with the default behavior of returning `{\"id\": str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), \"text\": str(obj)}`. The `get()` method is then updated to use this method to construct the results list. This change ensures that the PR's goal of enabling easy customization of autocomplete responses through overriding `serialize_result` is fully achieved.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
