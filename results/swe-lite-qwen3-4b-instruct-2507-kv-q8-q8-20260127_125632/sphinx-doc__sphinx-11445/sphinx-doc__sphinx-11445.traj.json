The `prepend_prolog` function is likely responsible for inserting the prolog content at the beginning of the RST file, and if it's not properly handling domain directives in headings, it could cause the heading to be misinterpreted.\n\nThe key insight is that when `rst_prolog` is applied, it adds content at the top of the RST file. If the first line of a document is a domain directive (e.g., `:mod:`), the parser might not correctly interpret it as a heading because the prolog content is being inserted before it. This could cause the heading to be ignored or not appear in the toctree.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that domain directives in headings are properly recognized and processed even when `rst_prolog` is present. The `prepend_prolog` function should be modified to preserve the structure of domain directives in headings. However, since we are only allowed to modify source files in the current directory and cannot modify the Sphinx source code directly, we must consider whether there's a configuration or utility that can handle this behavior.\n\nGiven that the issue is specific to Sphinx's behavior and not a configuration issue, and since we are restricted to modifying only files in the current directory, it's likely that the fix lies in a utility function or configuration that handles domain directives.
