      "content": "THOUGHT: The issue described is about LaTeX parsing of fractions in SymPy, where the expression `\\\\frac{\\\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\\\frac{1}{c^2}}` is incorrectly parsed as `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)` instead of the expected `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`. This suggests that the parser is not properly handling nested fractions or adding necessary parentheses in the denominator. The root cause is likely in the SymPy LaTeX parser's logic for handling nested fractions. I need to locate the relevant file in the codebase that handles LaTeX parsing, which is likely in `sympy/parsing/latex.py`. I will first check the contents of that file to understand the parsing logic and identify where the missing brackets are introduced.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/sympy/parsing/latex.py | grep -A 10 -B 10 \"frac\"\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The issue described is about LaTeX parsing of fractions in SymPy, where the expression `\\\\frac{\\\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\\\frac{1}{c^2}}` is incorrectly parsed as `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)` instead of the expected `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`. This suggests that the parser is not properly handling nested fractions or adding necessary parentheses in the denominator. The root cause is likely in the SymPy LaTeX parser's logic for handling nested fractions. I need to locate the relevant file in the codebase that handles LaTeX parsing, which is likely in `sympy/parsing/latex.py`. I will first check the contents of that file to understand the parsing logic and identify where the missing brackets are introduced.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/sympy/parsing/latex.py | grep -A 10 -B 10 \"frac\"\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT: The `convert_frac` function in `_parse_latex_antlr.py` is responsible for parsing fractions in LaTeX. The issue described in the PR arises because the parser does not properly handle the denominator of a fraction when it itself contains a fraction. Specifically, in the current implementation, the denominator is parsed as `convert_expr(frac.lower)` and then inverted using `sympy.Pow(expr_bot, -1, evaluate=False)`, which results in incorrect expression structure. The expected output `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))` requires proper bracketing around the denominator, especially when it is itself a fraction. The current implementation does not add parentheses around the denominator, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the `convert_frac` function to ensure that the denominator is properly enclosed in parentheses when it is a complex expression (like a fraction).
