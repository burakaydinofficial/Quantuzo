I will now modify the file to include the `has_add_permission` condition, ensuring the logic aligns with the PR's suggestion.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '102s/\"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup/\"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup and has_add_permission/' django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py\n```\n\nThe command replaces the existing condition at line 102 with the updated one that includes `has_add_permission`, as per the PR description. This ensures that \"show_save_as_new\" is only shown when the user has the necessary permissions.
