However, I cannot run Python code in the current environment as per the instructions. Instead, I will ensure that the change I made to the file is correct and complete. The addition of the `limit` method in the `bell` class should now return `oo` when taking the limit as `n` approaches infinity, which aligns with the mathematical behavior of Bell numbers.\n\nSince I cannot run the test script in this environment, I will finalize the change and submit it.\n\n```bash\ngit add /testbed/sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py\n```",
