It currently checks for exactly one constraint name when deleting an index, but fails when there are both a unique_together and an index_together on the same fields. The method excludes both constraints from the model's constraints and indexes when looking for the constraint name, which means it will not find the index constraint if there's a unique_together constraint on the same fields. This leads to the error \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\". To fix this, we need to modify the logic to properly handle cases where both unique_together and index_together exist on the same fields. The fix should ensure that when deleting an index_together, it only considers the index constraint and not the unique constraint. I will modify the `_delete_composed_index` method to correctly handle this scenario by adjusting the constraint name lookup logic.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|constraint_names = self._constraint_names|constraint_names = self._constraint_names(model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names, **constraint_kwargs)|g' django/db/backends/base/schema.py\n```\n",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The code shows that the issue lies in the `_delete_composed_index` method. It currently checks for exactly one constraint name when deleting an index, but fails when there are both a unique_together and an index_together on the same fields. The method excludes both constraints from the model's constraints and indexes when looking for the constraint name, which means it will not find the index constraint if there's a unique_together constraint on the same fields. This leads to the error \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\". To fix this, we need to modify the logic to properly handle cases where both unique_together and index_together exist on the same fields. The fix should ensure that when deleting an index_together, it only considers the index constraint and not the unique constraint. I will modify the `_delete_composed_index` method to correctly handle this scenario by adjusting the constraint name lookup logic.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|constraint_names = self._constraint_names|constraint_names = self._constraint_names(model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names, **constraint_kwargs)|g' django/db/backends/base/schema.py\n```\n",
