The current logic only copies the `ordering` if the child model does not already have its own `ordering`, but it does not handle the case where the parent's `ordering` includes a negative sign (e.g., \"-pk\"). This means that even though the parent model has `ordering = [\"-pk\"]`, the child model will inherit it as `[\"pk\"]` instead of `[\"-pk\"]`.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the code to ensure that the parent's `ordering` is correctly propagated to the child model, preserving the negative sign. The fix should be to preserve the negative sign when copying the parent's `ordering` to the child model.\n\nI will now modify the `base.py` file to ensure that the parent's `ordering` is correctly propagated to the child model, preserving the negative sign.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if not hasattr(meta, 'ordering'): new_class._meta.ordering = base_meta.ordering/if not hasattr(meta, 'ordering') and base_meta.ordering: new_class._meta.ordering = base_meta.ordering/g' django/db/models/base.py\n```\n\nThis command modifies the code to ensure that the parent's `ordering` is copied to the child model only if it exists and is not empty, preserving the negative sign. This should fix the issue described in the PR.\n\nAfter making this change, I will verify that the fix works by checking the content of the file again to ensure that the change has been applied correctly.\n\n```bash\ncat django/db/models/base.py | grep -A 5 -B 5 \"ordering\"\n```",
