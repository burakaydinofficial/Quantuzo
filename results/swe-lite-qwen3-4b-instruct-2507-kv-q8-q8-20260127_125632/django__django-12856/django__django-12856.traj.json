This suggests that the validation should happen during the migration creation process, likely in the `makemigrations` command.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `UniqueConstraint` class in `constraints.py` shows that it relies on `model._meta.get_field(field_name)` to access field details, which means it assumes the fields exist in the model. However, the PR description indicates that makemigrations does not validate that these fields actually exist. This suggests that the validation should happen during the migration creation process, likely in the `makemigrations` command. The relevant file for this functionality is likely `makemigrations.py` in the core Django management commands. I will now examine this file to identify where the validation for UniqueConstraint fields should be implemented.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT: The `model_checks.py` file contains model-level validation logic, but it does not explicitly validate that fields referenced in a UniqueConstraint exist in the model. The PR description indicates that the older `unique_together` syntax raises a models.E012 error if fields don't exist, but the new `UniqueConstraint` does not. This suggests that the validation should be implemented in the model validation logic, specifically in the `check_all_models` function. However, the current implementation in `model_checks.py` does not check for field existence in constraints. To fix this, we need to modify the `check_all_models` function to validate that all fields referenced in a UniqueConstraint exist in the model. Since the PR description is about a change to makemigrations, and the current implementation in `model_checks.py` does not validate field existence, we need to add a check for field existence in the model constraints. I will now create a patch to add this validation.\n\n```bash\ncat > /testbed/django/core/checks/model_checks.py << 'EOL'\nimport inspect\nimport types\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom itertools import chain\n\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.checks import Error, Tags, Warning, register\n\n\n@register(Tags.models)\ndef check_all_models(app_configs=None, **kwargs):\n    db_table_models = defaultdict(list)\n    indexes = defaultdict(list)\n    constraints = defaultdict(list)\n    errors = []\n    if app_configs is None:\n        models = apps.get_models()\n    else:\n        models = chain.from_iterable(app_config.get_models() for app_config in app_configs)\n    for model in models:\n        if model._meta.managed and not model._meta.proxy:\n            db_table_models[model._meta.db_table].append(model._meta.label)\n        if not inspect.ismethod(model.check):\n            errors.append(\n                Error(\n                    \"The '%s.check()' class method is currently overridden by %r.\"\n                    % (model.__name__, model.check),\n                    obj=model,\n                    id='models.E020'\n                )\n            )\n        else:\n            errors.extend(model.check(**kwargs))\n        for model_index in model._meta.indexes:\n            indexes[model_index.name].append(model._meta.label)\n        for model_constraint in model._meta.constraints:\n            if isinstance(model_constraint, UniqueConstraint):\n                # Check if all fields in the constraint exist in the model\n                for field_name in model_constraint.fields:\n                    if not hasattr(model._meta.get_field(field_name), 'column'):\n                        errors.append(\n                            Error(\n                                \"UniqueConstraint field '%s' does not exist in model '%s'.\" % (\n                                    field_name, model._meta.label\n                                ),\n                                obj=model,\n                                id='models.E012',\n                            )\n                        )\n    if settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS:\n        error_class, error_id = Warning, 'models.W035'\n        error_hint = (\n            'You have configured settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `model_checks.py` file contains model-level validation logic, but it does not explicitly validate that fields referenced in a UniqueConstraint exist in the model. The PR description indicates that the older `unique_together` syntax raises a models.E012 error if fields don't exist, but the new `UniqueConstraint` does not. This suggests that the validation should be implemented in the model validation logic, specifically in the `check_all_models` function. However, the current implementation in `model_checks.py` does not check for field existence in constraints. To fix this, we need to modify the `check_all_models` function to validate that all fields referenced in a UniqueConstraint exist in the model. Since the PR description is about a change to makemigrations, and the current implementation in `model_checks.py` does not validate field existence, we need to add a check for field existence in the model constraints. I will now create a patch to add this validation.\n\n```bash\ncat > /testbed/django/core/checks/model_checks.py << 'EOL'\nimport inspect\nimport types\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom itertools import chain\n\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.checks import Error, Tags, Warning, register\n\n\n@register(Tags.models)\ndef check_all_models(app_configs=None, **kwargs):\n    db_table_models = defaultdict(list)\n    indexes = defaultdict(list)\n    constraints = defaultdict(list)\n    errors = []\n    if app_configs is None:\n        models = apps.get_models()\n    else:\n        models = chain.from_iterable(app_config.get_models() for app_config in app_configs)\n    for model in models:\n        if model._meta.managed and not model._meta.proxy:\n            db_table_models[model._meta.db_table].append(model._meta.label)\n        if not inspect.ismethod(model.check):\n            errors.append(\n                Error(\n                    \"The '%s.check()' class method is currently overridden by %r.\"\n                    % (model.__name__, model.check),\n                    obj=model,\n                    id='models.E020'\n                )\n            )\n        else:\n            errors.extend(model.check(**kwargs))\n        for model_index in model._meta.indexes:\n            indexes[model_index.name].append(model._meta.label)\n        for model_constraint in model._meta.constraints:\n            if isinstance(model_constraint, UniqueConstraint):\n                # Check if all fields in the constraint exist in the model\n                for field_name in model_constraint.fields:\n                    if not hasattr(model._meta.get_field(field_name), 'column'):\n                        errors.append(\n                            Error(\n                                \"UniqueConstraint field '%s' does not exist in model '%s'.\" % (\n                                    field_name, model._meta.label\n                                ),\n                                obj=model,\n                                id='models.E012',\n                            )\n                        )\n    if settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS:\n        error_class, error_id = Warning, 'models.W035'\n        error_hint = (\n            'You have configured settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS.
