Since the issue is about Django's behavior in version 2.2 regarding table name conflicts across apps, and we are working in a directory that appears to be a clone of the Django source code, the actual fix might not be in user code but in Django's own source.\n\nHowever, the PR description suggests that the issue is in a real-world application using Django, not in the Django source. Given that we are in the `testbed` directory and the issue is about multiple apps sharing table names, the most likely cause is that the application is not properly configuring database-specific settings or using a database alias to isolate tables.\n\nSince we are not given any specific files or model code, and the issue is about Django's behavior in version 2.2, I should check for a configuration file that might control database settings or model naming.

Since the issue is about Django's behavior in version 2.2 regarding table name conflicts across apps, and we are working in a directory that appears to be a clone of the Django source code, the actual fix might not be in user code but in Django's own source.\n\nHowever, the PR description suggests that the issue is in a real-world application using Django, not in the Django source. Given that we are in the `testbed` directory and the issue is about multiple apps sharing table names, the most likely cause is that the application is not properly configuring database-specific settings or using a database alias to isolate tables.\n\nSince we are not given any specific files or model code, and the issue is about Django's behavior in version 2.2, I should check for a configuration file that might control database settings or model naming. The most likely candidate is `settings.py` or a similar configuration file.\n\nI will look for a `settings.py` file in the `django` directory or in the root, as it is the most likely place where database configuration would be defined.\n\n```bash\nfind . -name \"settings.py\" -type f\n```",
