However, the error occurs during session decoding, and the traceback points to `base64.b64decode` failing due to incorrect padding. This is a known issue in Django session handling when session data is corrupted.\n\nSince the error occurs during session decoding and the traceback shows that the session data is corrupted, the most likely fix is to add error handling in the session backend to gracefully handle corrupted session data. The `base64.b64decode` call should be wrapped in a try-except block to catch `binascii.Error` and return an empty session instead of crashing.\n\nI will now check the actual session backend file to locate the relevant code and add the necessary error handling.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py | grep -A 5 -B 5 \"_legacy_decode\"\n```",
