Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The problematic line in `fu.py` at line 504 attempts to compare a complex exponent using `(rv.exp < 0) == True`, which is invalid. I have already identified the correct line and replaced it with a safer condition that checks if the exponent is real and negative using `rv.exp.is_real and rv.exp < 0`. This ensures that the comparison only occurs when the exponent is a real number, avoiding invalid comparisons with complex numbers. The fix is now in place.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
