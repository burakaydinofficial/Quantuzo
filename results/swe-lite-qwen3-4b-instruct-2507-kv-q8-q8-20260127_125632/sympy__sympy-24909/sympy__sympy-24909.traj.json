The issue is that the method should return 1 when a prefix is multiplied by a unit, not when a prefix is multiplied by another prefix or a quantity with a scale factor.\n\nAfter reviewing the code carefully, I realize that the `__mul__` method needs to be updated to check if the other object is a unit or a quantity with a unit. Specifically, I need to check if the other object has a unit attribute, and if so, return 1. This will ensure that `milli * W` evaluates to 1, as expected.\n\nI will now update the `__mul__` method to include this check.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def __mul__\\(self, other\\):/def __mul__(self, other):\\n    if not isinstance(other, (Quantity, Prefix)):\\n        return super().__mul__(other)\\n    \\n    fact = self.scale_factor * other.scale_factor\\n    \\n    if fact == 1:\\n        return 0\\n    elif isinstance(other, Prefix):\\n        # simplify prefix\\n        for p in PREFIXES:\\n            if PREFIXES[p].scale_factor == fact:\\n                return PREFIXES[p]\\n        return fact\\n    \\n    return self.scale_factor * other/' /testbed/sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py\n```\n",
