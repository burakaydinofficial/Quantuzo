The class processes responses when the request has an If-Modified-Since header, and it checks for ETag or Last-Modified headers. However, the code does not explicitly handle empty strings for the If-Modified-Since header. The issue described in the PR likely arises when an empty string is passed to the `If-Modified-Since` header, which currently raises an exception. To fix this, I need to modify the code to safely handle empty strings by either ignoring them or treating them as None. Since the PR description indicates that empty strings were previously ignored, I will modify the code to skip processing if the header is empty. I will now edit the `django/middleware/http.py` file to add a check for empty strings in the `If-Modified-Since` header.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/If-Modified-Since: \\([^ \\t\\n]*\\)/If-Modified-Since: \\1/g' django/middleware/http.py\n```\n\nThis command does not correctly address the issue because it only replaces the header value without checking for empty strings. I need to modify the code to explicitly handle empty strings. I will now search for the specific section where the If-Modified-Since header is processed and add a guard clause to skip processing if the header is empty.\n\n```bash\ncat django/middleware/http.py | grep -A 10 -B 5 \"If-Modified-Since\"\n```\n\nThis will help me locate the exact section where the header is processed and allow me to modify it appropriately.\n\n```bash\ncat django/middleware/http.py | grep -A 10 -B 5 \"If-Modified-Since\"\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `django/middleware/http.py` file contains a `ConditionalGetMiddleware` class that handles conditional GET operations, including the If-Modified-Since header. The class processes responses when the request has an If-Modified-Since header, and it checks for ETag or Last-Modified headers. However, the code does not explicitly handle empty strings for the If-Modified-Since header. The issue described in the PR likely arises when an empty string is passed to the `If-Modified-Since` header, which currently raises an exception. To fix this, I need to modify the code to safely handle empty strings by either ignoring them or treating them as None. Since the PR description indicates that empty strings were previously ignored, I will modify the code to skip processing if the header is empty. I will now edit the `django/middleware/http.py` file to add a check for empty strings in the `If-Modified-Since` header.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/If-Modified-Since: \\([^ \\t\\n]*\\)/If-Modified-Since: \\1/g' django/middleware/http.py\n```\n\nThis command does not correctly address the issue because it only replaces the header value without checking for empty strings. I need to modify the code to explicitly handle empty strings. I will now search for the specific section where the If-Modified-Since header is processed and add a guard clause to skip processing if the header is empty.\n\n```bash\ncat django/middleware/http.py | grep -A 10 -B 5 \"If-Modified-Since\"\n```\n\nThis will help me locate the exact section where the header is processed and allow me to modify it appropriately.\n\n```bash\ncat django/middleware/http.py | grep -A 10 -B 5 \"If-Modified-Since\"\n```",
