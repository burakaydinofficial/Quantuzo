This is a known issue in scikit-learn where the sign of the output can vary due to the random initialization of the kernel PCA transformation. The problem arises because the kernel PCA transformation is not deterministic in sign due to the nature of the RBF kernel and the way the eigenvectors are computed. To fix this, we need to ensure that the sign of the output is consistent across runs. This can be achieved by enforcing a consistent sign convention, such as ensuring the first component is always positive. The relevant code is likely in the KernelPCA class implementation.
