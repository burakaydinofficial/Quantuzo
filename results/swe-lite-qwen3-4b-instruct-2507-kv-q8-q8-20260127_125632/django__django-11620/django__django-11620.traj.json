                "content": "THOUGHT: The `converters.py` file shows that `PathConverter` is a base class for path converters, inheriting from `StringConverter`. The `to_python` method in `PathConverter` simply returns the value as is, without any error handling for invalid values. The PR description suggests that raising an `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method should result in a 404 with a helpful error message when DEBUG is True, rather than a generic server error. Since the current implementation does not handle `Http404` exceptions, I need to modify the `to_python` method in `PathConverter` to raise an `Http404` exception when the value is invalid, and ensure that the URL resolver properly handles this exception to return a 404 with a helpful error message when DEBUG is True.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/django/urls/converters.py | sed 's/def to_python(self, value):/def to_python(self, value):\\n    try:\\n        return super().to_python(value)\\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\\n        raise Http404()/g'\n```\n\nWait, I cannot use `Http404` in the sed command because it is not defined in the file. I need to modify the file to properly raise an `Http404` exception when the value is invalid. I will now edit the file to include the necessary import and modify the `to_python` method.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '1i\\\\nfrom django.http import Http404' /testbed/django/urls/converters.py\n```\n\nNow I will modify the `to_python` method in `PathConverter` to raise an `Http404` exception when the value is invalid.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def to_python(self, value):/def to_python(self, value):\\n    try:\\n        return super().to_python(value)\\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\\n        raise Http404()/g' /testbed/django/urls/converters.py\n```",
