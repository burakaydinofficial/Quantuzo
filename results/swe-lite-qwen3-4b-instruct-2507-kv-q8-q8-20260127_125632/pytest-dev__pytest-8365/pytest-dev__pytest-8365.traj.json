Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
