The correct location for this fix is in the `_blockmul` method, where the blocks are being processed. However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle zero blocks.\n\nI will now modify the `_blockmul` method to ensure that any zero blocks are converted to `ZeroMatrix` objects with the correct shape before multiplication. This will prevent the AttributeError when accessing the `cols` attribute.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)/return BlockMatrix([[ZeroMatrix(block.shape) if isinstance(block, Zero) else block for block in row] for row in self.blocks]) * other.blocks/' /testbed/sympy/matrices/expresssions/blockmatrix.py\n```\n\nWait \u2014 I notice there's a typo in the file path: it should be `/testbed/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`, not `/testbed/sympy/matrices/expresssions/blockmatrix.py`. I will correct this and ensure the fix is applied properly.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)/return BlockMatrix([[ZeroMatrix(block.shape) if isinstance(block, Zero) else block for block in row] for row in self.blocks]) * other.blocks/' /testbed/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py\n```",
