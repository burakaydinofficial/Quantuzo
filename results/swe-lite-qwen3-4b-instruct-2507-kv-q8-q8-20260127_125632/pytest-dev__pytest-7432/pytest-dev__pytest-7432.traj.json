The current code does not set the skip location at all, and the location is incorrectly reported from an internal path. \n\nThe correct fix is to modify the hook to explicitly set the skip location using `item.location` when a test is skipped. This requires adding a condition to check if the test is skipped and then setting the location in the report. \n\nI will now directly modify the hook to include the correct location reporting logic.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if not item.config.option.runxfail:|if not item.config.option.runxfail and not item.get_closest_marker(\"skip\"):|g' src/_pytest/skipping.py\n```\n",
