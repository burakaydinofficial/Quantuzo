The issue arises when a subquery references a related field (like `a_id` in the `AB` model) and Django fails to include that field in the GROUP BY clause, leading to an ambiguous column reference error.\n\nThis suggests that the fix lies in the code that generates SQL queries for annotations involving related fields. The most likely location of this code is in `django/db/models/queries.py`, specifically in the logic that handles subqueries and GROUP BY clauses.
