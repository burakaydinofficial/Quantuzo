Since `replace` returns a copy, I need to ensure the original `output_field` is updated in-place. The fix should replace the line that uses `replace` with an in-place assignment using the same method, ensuring the change is applied correctly. I will now edit the file using `sed` to update the relevant line.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/    output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))/    output_field = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))/g' /testbed/astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py\n```",
