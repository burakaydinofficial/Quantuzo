This indicates that the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class inherits from `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`, which is missing the `get_response_async` method. Therefore, I need to locate the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` class and add the `get_response_async` method to it. The most likely location is in `django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py`.
