This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\r\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\r\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression.

However, the method currently does not use the `mode` parameter to open the file. To complete the implementation, I need to modify the method to open the file using the specified mode and pass the file handle to the `load` function. This requires updating the method's body to use `open` with the provided mode and ensure that the file is properly closed after reading. I will now update the method body to include the file opening logic with the `mode` parameter.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def from_file(self, filename: str, load: t.Callable[[t.IO[t.Any]], t.Mapping], silent: bool = False, mode: str = \"r\")/def from_file(self, filename: str, load: t.Callable[[t.IO[t.Any]], t.Mapping], silent: bool = False, mode: str = \"r\"): \\n    try:\\n        with open(filename, mode) as file:\\n            data = load(file)\\n            self.from_mapping(data)\\n    except (OSError, IOError) as e:\\n        if not silent:\\n            raise e/' src/flask/config.py\n```\n</format_example>",
