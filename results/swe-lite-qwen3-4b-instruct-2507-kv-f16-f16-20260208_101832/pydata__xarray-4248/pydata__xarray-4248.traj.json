The `summarize_variable` function is responsible for formatting variable representations and includes the variable's dimensions, dtype, and values. To implement the feature of showing units in the dataset overview, I need to modify `summarize_variable` to include unit information if available. \n\nThe `summarize_variable` function already includes the variable's dimensions and dtype, and I can extend it to include the unit attribute if it exists. I will modify `summarize_variable` to check for a `units` attribute in the variable and append it to the representation if present. This change will ensure that units are shown in the dataset overview as requested in the PR description.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/return front_str + values_str/front_str + values_str + (f\" in
