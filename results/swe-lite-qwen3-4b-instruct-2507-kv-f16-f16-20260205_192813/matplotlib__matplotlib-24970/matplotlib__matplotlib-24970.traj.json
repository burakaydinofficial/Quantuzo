Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

It mirrors the exact code from the PR description that triggers the deprecation warnings. Since the fix was applied to `matplotlib/colors.py`, and the script now uses the updated casting method, running this script should now produce no deprecation warnings. I will now execute the script to verify that the warnings have been resolved.\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; import numpy as np; plt.get_cmap()(np.empty((0,), dtype=np.uint8))\" 2>&1 | grep -i \"deprecation\"\n```",
