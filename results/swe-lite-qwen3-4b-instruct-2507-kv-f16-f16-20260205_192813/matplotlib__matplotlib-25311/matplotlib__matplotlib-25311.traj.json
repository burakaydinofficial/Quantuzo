Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

The most relevant code for handling draggable elements and pickling is likely in the backend-specific canvas classes, such as `FigureCanvasQTAgg`.\n\nSince the error occurs during pickling and involves the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object, I should look for the backend-specific implementation of `FigureCanvasQTAgg` in the matplotlib source code.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The `backend_qtagg.py` file shows that `FigureCanvasQTAgg` inherits from `FigureCanvasAgg` and `FigureCanvasQT`. The issue described in the PR is about pickling a figure with a draggable legend, which fails due to the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object not being pickleable. The root cause is likely that the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class does not implement proper pickling support, especially when interactive features like draggable legends are enabled.\n\nIn matplotlib, pickling of figure objects is typically handled by the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods. Since `FigureCanvasQTAgg` inherits from `FigureCanvasAgg`, which is based on `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg`, and the error occurs during pickling, the issue might be that the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class does not override `__getstate__` or `__setstate__` to handle its interactive components (like draggable legends).\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that `FigureCanvasQTAgg` properly implements pickling by overriding `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` to preserve the state of interactive elements. However, since the PR description does not specify a particular file to modify and the issue is about backend-specific pickling, the most appropriate fix would be to add or modify the pickling logic in `backend_qtagg.py`.\n\nI will now modify `backend_qtagg.py` to add proper pickling support for `FigureCanvasQTAgg` by implementing `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods.\n\n```bash\ncat << 'EOF' > /testbed/lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qtagg.py\n\"\"\"\nRender to qt from agg.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport ctypes\n\nfrom matplotlib.transforms import Bbox\n\nfrom .qt_compat import QT_API, _enum\nfrom .backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg\nfrom .backend_qt import QtCore, QtGui, _BackendQT, FigureCanvasQT\nfrom .backend_qt import (  # noqa: F401 # pylint: disable=W0611\n    FigureManagerQT, NavigationToolbar2QT)\n\n\nclass FigureCanvasQTAgg(FigureCanvasAgg, FigureCanvasQT):\n\n    def paintEvent(self, event):\n        \"\"\"\n        Copy the image from the Agg canvas to the qt.drawable.\n\n        In Qt, all drawing should be done inside of here when a widget is\n        shown onscreen.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._draw_idle()  # Only does something if a draw is pending.\n\n        # If the canvas does not have a renderer, then give up and wait for\n        # FigureCanvasAgg.draw(self) to be called.\n        if not hasattr(self, 'renderer'):\n            return\n\n        painter = QtGui.QPainter(self)\n        try:\n            # See documentation of QRect: bottom() and right() are off\n            # by 1, so use left() + width() and top() + height().\n            rect = event.rect()\n            # scale rect dimensions using the screen dpi ratio to get\n            # correct values for the Figure coordinates (rather than\n            # QT5's coords)\n            width = rect.width() * self.device_pixel_ratio\n            height = rect.height() * self.device_pixel_ratio\n            left, top = self.mouseEventCoords(rect.topLeft())\n            # shift the \"top\" by the height of the image to get the\n            # correct corner for our coordinate system\n            bottom = top - height\n            # same with the right side of the image\n            right = left + width\n            # create a buffer using the image bounding box\n            bbox = Bbox([[left, bottom], [right, top]])\n            buf = memoryview(self.copy_from_bbox(bbox))\n\n            if QT_API == \"PyQt6\":\n                from PyQt6 import sip\n                ptr = int(sip.voidptr(buf))\n            else:\n                ptr = buf\n\n            painter.eraseRect(rect)  # clear the widget canvas\n            qimage = QtGui.QImage(ptr, buf.shape[1], buf.shape[0],\n                                  _enum(\"QtGui.QImage.Format\").Format_RGBA8888)\n            qimage.setDevicePixelRatio(self.device_pixel_ratio)\n            # set origin using original QT coordinates\n            origin = QtCore.QPoint(rect.left(), rect.top())\n            painter.drawImage(origin, qimage)\n            # Adjust the buf reference count to work around a memory\n            # leak bug in QImage under PySide.\n            if QT_API == \"PySide2\" and QtCore.__version_info__ < (5, 12):\n                ctypes.c_long.from_address(id(buf)).value = 1\n\n            self._draw_rect_callback(painter)\n        finally:\n            painter.end()\n\n    def __getstate__(self):\n        \"\"\"Custom pickling for FigureCanvasQTAgg.\"\"\"\n        state = super().__getstate__()\n        # Ensure interactive elements like draggable legends are preserved\n        # during pickling by including their state\n        # This is a placeholder; actual implementation may require deeper\n        # integration with matplotlib's figure state management.\n        return state\n\n    def __setstate__(self, state):\n        \"\"\"Restore state after pickling for FigureCanvasQTAgg.\"\"\"\n        super().__setstate__(state)\n        # Reinitialize any interactive elements that might have been lost\n        # during pickling\n        # This is a placeholder; actual implementation may require deeper\n        # integration with matplotlib's figure state management.\n        pass\n\n@_BackendQT.export\nclass _BackendQTAgg(_BackendQT):\n    FigureCanvas = FigureCanvasQTAgg\nEOF\n```\n",
