The problem occurs in the `on_changed` callback of the range slider, where `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` are causing input blocking to widgets. Since `pyplot.draw()` is likely causing the event loop to block or interfere with widget input, removing or replacing it with a safer update mechanism (like using `plt.pause()` or ensuring the figure is updated properly) may resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, in Matplotlib, `pyplot.draw()` in callbacks can interfere with event handling, especially in interactive backends like QtAgg. A better approach is to avoid calling `pyplot.draw()` in callbacks and instead rely on Matplotlib's automatic redraw mechanism. Alternatively, we can remove `pyplot.draw()` entirely and let Matplotlib handle the redraw.\n\nI will now modify the script to remove `pyplot.draw()` in the slider callback and keep it only in the button callback, to see if this resolves the issue.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/pyplot.draw()//g' test_slider_bug.py\n```\n",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The test script has been created to reproduce the issue. The problem occurs in the `on_changed` callback of the range slider, where `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` are causing input blocking to widgets. Since `pyplot.draw()` is likely causing the event loop to block or interfere with widget input, removing or replacing it with a safer update mechanism (like using `plt.pause()` or ensuring the figure is updated properly) may resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, in Matplotlib, `pyplot.draw()` in callbacks can interfere with event handling, especially in interactive backends like QtAgg. A better approach is to avoid calling `pyplot.draw()` in callbacks and instead rely on Matplotlib's automatic redraw mechanism. Alternatively, we can remove `pyplot.draw()` entirely and let Matplotlib handle the redraw.\n\nI will now modify the script to remove `pyplot.draw()` in the slider callback and keep it only in the button callback, to see if this resolves the issue.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/pyplot.draw()//g' test_slider_bug.py\n```\n",
