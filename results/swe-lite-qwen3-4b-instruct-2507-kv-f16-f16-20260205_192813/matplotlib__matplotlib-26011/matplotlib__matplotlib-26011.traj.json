Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The PR description points out a bug in matplotlib where `xlim_changed` callbacks are not emitted when an axis is shared with another via `sharex`. The issue is in `_base.py` where `set_xlim` calls `emit=False` for shared axes, which prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being triggered. The user suggests moving the callback emission outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it's triggered even when changes are propagated through shared axes. I need to locate the relevant file and modify the code to emit the callback regardless of whether the shared axis is being updated with `emit=False`.\n\nThe file in question is likely `matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`. I will check if this file exists and then modify the `set_xlim` method to emit the callback outside the `emit=False` block.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"set_xlim\" matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The PR description points out a bug in matplotlib where `xlim_changed` callbacks are not emitted when an axis is shared with another via `sharex`. The issue is in `_base.py` where `set_xlim` calls `emit=False` for shared axes, which prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being triggered. The user suggests moving the callback emission outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it's triggered even when changes are propagated through shared axes. I need to locate the relevant file and modify the code to emit the callback regardless of whether the shared axis is being updated with `emit=False`.\n\nThe file in question is likely `matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`. I will check if this file exists and then modify the `set_xlim` method to emit the callback outside the `emit=False` block.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"set_xlim\" matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT: The search results show that the file `./lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` exists in the repository. This confirms the correct path for the file mentioned in the PR description. Now that I have located the file, I will edit it to fix the issue described in the PR. The issue is that `xlim_changed` callbacks are not emitted when an axis is shared with another via `sharex`. The problem occurs in the `set_xlim` method where `emit=False` is used for shared axes, which prevents the callback from being triggered. I will modify the code to emit the callback outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it is triggered even when changes are propagated through shared axes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if

                "content": "THOUGHT: The search results show that the file `./lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` exists in the repository. This confirms the correct path for the file mentioned in the PR description. Now that I have located the file, I will edit it to fix the issue described in the PR. The issue is that `xlim_changed` callbacks are not emitted when an axis is shared with another via `sharex`. The problem occurs in the `set_xlim` method where `emit=False` is used for shared axes, which prevents the callback from being triggered. I will modify the code to emit the callback outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it is triggered even when changes are propagated through shared axes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if

The problem is in the `set_xlim` method where `emit=False` is used for shared axes, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered. I need to modify the code to emit the callback outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it is triggered when changes are propagated through shared axes. I will now edit the file to make this change.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if emit:\\\\s*\\\\n\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\-than' ./lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\n```",

The problem is in the `set_xlim` method where `emit=False` is used for shared axes, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered. I need to modify the code to emit the callback outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it is triggered when changes are propagated through shared axes. I will now edit the file to make this change.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if emit:\\\\s*\\\\n\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\-than' ./lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: I have located the relevant method `set_xlim` in the file at line 3570. The method currently has an `emit=True` parameter and calls `emit=False` for shared axes. I need to modify the code to emit the `xlim_changed` callback outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it is triggered when changes are propagated through shared axes. I will now edit the file to make this change.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '3570s/if

The issue is that the `xlim_changed` callback is not being emitted when changes are propagated through shared axes. The current code emits the callback only if `emit=True`, and for shared axes, it uses `emit=False`.

The issue is that the `xlim_changed` callback is not being emitted when changes are propagated through shared axes. The current code emits the callback only if `emit=True`, and for shared axes, it uses `emit=False`. I need to modify the code to emit the callback outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it is triggered when changes are propagated through shared axes.

                "content": "THOUGHT: I have located the `set_xlim` method in the file. The method is defined with an `emit=True` parameter and calls `emit=False` for shared axes. I need to modify the code to emit the `xlim_changed` callback outside the `if emit:` block to ensure it is triggered when changes are propagated through shared axes. I will now edit the file to make this change by replacing the specific code block with the modified version.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '3570s/if
