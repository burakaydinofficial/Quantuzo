When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The error occurs when using matplotlib's 3D plotting with Line3D objects, specifically when trying to access the '_verts3d' attribute. This attribute is typically used internally by matplotlib to store vertex data for 3D lines. The issue arises because the input data is being incorrectly interpreted\u2014specifically, the use of `np.array(['my int number list'])` creates a list of strings, not numeric arrays. When the code attempts to convert these strings to integers using `int()`, it fails silently, leading to invalid data types that cause the AttributeError.\n\nThe root cause is that `x_s_0[n]` is a string (from `np.array(['my int number list'])`), and when `int()` is applied to a string that is not a valid integer, it raises a ValueError. This error propagates and corrupts the Line3D object state, leading to the missing '_verts3d' attribute. The fix is to ensure that all inputs are properly initialized as numeric arrays (e.g., integers or floats) from the start.\n\nI will modify the script to initialize the arrays with proper numeric values (e.g., integers or floats) instead of strings, and ensure that the data types are correct before plotting.\n\n```bash\ncat << 'EOF' > test_plot.py\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Correctly initialize arrays with numeric values\nx_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nx_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\ny_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ny_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\nz_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nz_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\nax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\nax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\nclr_list = 'r-'\n\nfor n in range(len(z_s_0)):\n    ax.plot([x_s_0[n], x_e_0[n]],\n            [y_s_0[n], y_e_0[n]],\n            [z_s_0[n], z_e_0[n]], clr_list)\n\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('90-0')\nplt.show()\nEOF\n```",

This attribute is typically used internally by matplotlib to store vertex data for 3D lines. The issue arises because the input data is being incorrectly interpreted\u2014specifically, the use of `np.array(['my int number list'])` creates a list of strings, not numeric arrays. When the code attempts to convert these strings to integers using `int()`, it fails silently, leading to invalid data types that cause the AttributeError.\n\nThe root cause is that `x_s_0[n]` is a string (from `np.array(['my int number list'])`), and when `int()` is applied to a string that is not a valid integer, it raises a ValueError. This error propagates and corrupts the Line3D object state, leading to the missing '_verts3d' attribute. The fix is to ensure that all inputs are properly initialized as numeric arrays (e.g., integers or floats) from the start.\n\nI will modify the script to initialize the arrays with proper numeric values (e.g., integers or floats) instead of strings, and ensure that the data types are correct before plotting.\n\n```bash\ncat << 'EOF' > test_plot.py\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Correctly initialize arrays with numeric values\nx_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nx_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\ny_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ny_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\nz_s_0 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nz_e_0 = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\nax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\nax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\nclr_list = 'r-'\n\nfor n in range(len(z_s_0)):\n    ax.plot([x_s_0[n], x_e_0[n]],\n            [y_s_0[n], y_e_0[n]],\n            [z_s_0[n], z_e_0[n]], clr_list)\n\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('90-0')\nplt.show()\nEOF\n```",
