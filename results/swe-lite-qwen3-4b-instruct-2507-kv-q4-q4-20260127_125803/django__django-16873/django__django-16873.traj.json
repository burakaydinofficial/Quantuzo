The problem is that the `autoescape` setting is being applied to the joining string (`arg`) via `conditional_escape(arg)` even when `autoescape` is `False`. According to the PR description, when `autoescape` is off, the joining string should not be escaped. The current code applies `conditional_escape` to both the list items (`value`) and the joining string (`arg`), which is incorrect. I need to modify the `join` filter to only apply `conditional_escape` to the list items when `autoescape` is `True`, and leave the joining string unescaped when `autoescape` is `False`.\n\nThe fix requires changing the `join` filter code to remove the `conditional_escape` on the `arg` when `autoescape` is `False`.
