Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1.

Instead, the logic for handling choices in ForeignKey fields with `limit_choices_to` is likely in `django/forms/models.py`, which handles model form fields. I need to check that file to locate the relevant code. This is a more probable location because model forms in Django often handle complex filtering logic like Q objects.\n\n```bash\ncat /testbed/django/forms/models.py | grep -A 10 -B 10 \"limit_choices_to\\|ForeignKey\"\n```",

The change ensures that if `limit_choices_to` is a callable (like a Q object), it is invoked and its result is used to filter the queryset. If it's not callable, the value is used directly. This prevents duplicate options from appearing in form fields when using a Q object. The fix is consistent with the PR description and addresses the root cause of the issue. The modification is targeted and general, as it applies to all cases involving `limit_choices_to` in ForeignKey fields.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
