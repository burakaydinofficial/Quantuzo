The function currently raises an exception when the header is empty (i.e., when `request.META.get(\"HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE\")` is an empty string). To fix this, we need to ensure that an empty string is handled gracefully \u2014 specifically, we should treat it as if the header is not present (i.e., ignore it). The current implementation likely passes an empty string to `was_modified_since`, which may trigger an exception due to the change in d6aff369ad3. We need to modify the code to check if the header is an empty string and handle it by treating it as None, so that the function behaves as before (i.e., ignore empty strings).
