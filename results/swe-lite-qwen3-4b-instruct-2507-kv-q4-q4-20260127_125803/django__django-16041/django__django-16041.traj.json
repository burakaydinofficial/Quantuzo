Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

However, the issue is about formset behavior when rendering `empty_form`, and the problem specifically occurs when `empty_permitted` is passed to `form_kwargs`. This suggests that the formset's `empty_form` rendering should ignore `empty_permitted` because it's not relevant for data submission. The most likely place to fix this is in a formset implementation, possibly in a file like `forms.py` or `model_formsets.py`. \n\nGiven that no such files are found, and since the PR description does not specify a particular file, I will assume that the formset behavior is defined in a standard Django formset implementation. The fix should be to modify the formset's `empty_form` rendering to ignore `empty_permitted`.

However, the issue is about formset behavior when rendering `empty_form`, and the problem specifically occurs when `empty_permitted` is passed to `form_kwargs`. This suggests that the formset's `empty_form` rendering should ignore `empty_permitted` because it's not relevant for data submission.
