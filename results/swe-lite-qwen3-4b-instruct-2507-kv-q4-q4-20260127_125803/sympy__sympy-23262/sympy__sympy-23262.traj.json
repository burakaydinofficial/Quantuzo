I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression.
