When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing.

Given that the issue is about Django's behavior during migration and proxy models, the problem might be in Django's core code rather than a project-specific migration. Since we are working within a testbed that likely does not contain the full Django source, and we are not allowed to modify test files outside of `/testbed`, I need to consider that the issue might be in how Django handles proxy models during permission updates. Without access to the actual migration file or Django source, I cannot directly modify the code. However, the error message indicates a duplicate key violation, which implies that the migration is attempting to insert a permission entry that already exists. A common fix for such issues in Django is to ensure that the migration properly checks for existing permissions before attempting to create them.

Since we are working within a testbed that likely does not contain the full Django source, and we are not allowed to modify test files outside of `/testbed`, I need to consider that the issue might be in how Django handles proxy models during permission updates.
