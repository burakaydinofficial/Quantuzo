Function and class can\nfilter the arguments by their kind, and behave differently according to\nthe type of itself.\n\nThis module defines basic kinds for core objects. Other kinds such as\n``ArrayKind`` or ``MatrixKind`` can be found in corresponding modules.\n\n.. notes::\n       This approach is experimental, and can be replaced or deleted in the future.\n       See https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/20549.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nfrom sympy.core.cache import cacheit\nfrom sympy.multipledispatch.dispatcher import (Dispatcher,\n    ambiguity_warn, ambiguity_register_error_ignore_dup,\n    str_signature, RaiseNotImplementedError)\n\n\nclass KindMeta(type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Metaclass for ``Kind``.\n\n    Assigns empty ``dict`` as class attribute ``_inst`` for every class,\n    in order to endow singleton-like behavior.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct):\n        dct['_inst'] = {}\n        return super().__new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct)\n\n\nclass Kind(object, metaclass=KindMeta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Base class for kinds.\n\n    Kind of the object represents the mathematical classification that\n    the entity falls into. It is expected that functions and classes\n    recognize and filter the argument by its kind.\n\n    Kind of every object must be carefully selected so that it shows the\n    intention of design. Expressions may have different kind according\n    to the kind of its arguements. For example, arguements of ``Add``\n    must have common kind since addition is group operator, and the\n    resulting ``Add()`` has the same kind.\n\n    For the performance, each kind is as broad as possible and is not\n    based on set theory. For example, ``NumberKind`` includes not only\n    complex number but expression containing ``S.Infinity`` or ``S.NaN``\n    which are not strictly number.\n\n    Kind may have arguments as parameter. For example, ``MatrixKind()``\n    may be constructed with one element which represents the kind of its\n    elements.\n\n    ``Kind`` behaves in singleton-like fashion.

By default, any object deriving from Expr\n        will behave like a scalar with self.diff(self) == 1. If this is\n        not desired then the object must also set `is_scalar = False` or\n        else define an _eval_derivative routine.\n\n        Note, see the docstring of Derivative for how this should work\n        mathematically. In particular, note that expr.subs(yourclass, Symbol)\n        should be well-defined on a structural level, or this will lead to\n        inconsistent results.\n\n        Examples\n        ========\n\n        >>> from sympy import Expr\n        >>> e = Expr()\n        >>> e._diff_wrt\n        False\n        >>> class MyScalar(Expr):\n        ...     _diff_wrt = True\n        ...\n        >>> MyScalar().diff(MyScalar())\n        1\n        >>> class MySymbol(Expr):\n        ...     _diff_wrt = True\n        ...     is_scalar = False\n        ...\n        >>> MySymbol().diff(MySymbol())\n        Derivative(MySymbol(), MySymbol())\n        \"\"\"\n        return False\n\n    @cacheit\n    def sort_key(self, order=None):\n\n        coeff, expr = self.as_coeff_Mul()\n\n        if expr.is_Pow:\n            if expr.base is S.Exp1:\n                # If we remove this, many doctests will go crazy:\n                # (keeps E**x sorted like the exp(x) function,\n                #  part of exp(x) to E**x transition)\n                expr, exp = Function(\"exp\")(expr.exp), S.One\n            else:\n                expr, exp = expr.args\n        else:\n            expr, exp = expr, S.One\n\n        if expr.is_Dummy:\n            args = (expr.sort_key(),)\n        elif expr.is_Atom:\n            args = (str(expr),)\n        else:\n            if expr.is_Add:\n                args = expr.as_ordered_terms(order=order)\n            elif expr.is_Mul:\n                args = expr.as_ordered_factors(order=order)\n            else:\n                args = expr.args\n\n            args = tuple(\n                [ default_sort_key(arg, order=order) for arg in args ])\n\n        args = (len(args), tuple(args))\n        exp = exp.sort_key(order=order)\n\n        return expr.class_key(), args, exp, coeff\n\n    def __hash__(self) -> int:\n        # hash cannot be cached using cache_it because infinite recurrence\n        # occurs as hash is needed for setting cache dictionary keys\n        h = self._mhash\n        if h is None:\n            h = hash((type(self).__name__,) + self._hashable_content())\n            self._mhash = h\n        return h\n\n    def _hashable_content(self):\n        \"\"\"Return a tuple of information about self that can be used to\n        compute the hash.

For example,\n``Integral(1, x)`` and ``Integral(Matrix([1,2]), x)`` are both instance\nof ``Integral`` class. However the former is number and the latter is\nmatrix.\n\nOne way to resolve this is defining subclass for each mathematical type,\nsuch as ``MatAdd`` for the addition between matrices. Basic algebraic\noperation such as addition or multiplication take this approach, but\ndefining every class for every mathematical object is not scalable.\n\nTherefore, we define the \"kind\" of the object and let the expression\ninfer the kind of itself from its arguments. Function and class can\nfilter the arguments by their kind, and behave differently according to\nthe type of itself.\n\nThis module defines basic kinds for core objects. Other kinds such as\n``ArrayKind`` or ``MatrixKind`` can be found in corresponding modules.\n\n.. notes::\n       This approach is experimental, and can be replaced or deleted in the future.\n       See https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/20549.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nfrom sympy.core.cache import cacheit\nfrom sympy.multipledispatch.dispatcher import (Dispatcher,\n    ambiguity_warn, ambiguity_register_error_ignore_dup,\n    str_signature, RaiseNotImplementedError)\n\n\nclass KindMeta(type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Metaclass for ``Kind``.\n\n    Assigns empty ``dict`` as class attribute ``_inst`` for every class,\n    in order to endow singleton-like behavior.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct):\n        dct['_inst'] = {}\n        return super().__new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct)\n\n\nclass Kind(object, metaclass=KindMeta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Base class for kinds.\n\n    Kind of the object represents the mathematical classification that\n    the entity falls into.

Expressions may have different kind according\n    to the kind of its arguements. For example, arguements of ``Add``\n    must have common kind since addition is group operator, and the\n    resulting ``Add()`` has the same kind.\n\n    For the performance, each kind is as broad as possible and is not\n    based on set theory. For example, ``NumberKind`` includes not only\n    complex number but expression containing ``S.Infinity`` or ``S.NaN``\n    which are not strictly number.\n\n    Kind may have arguments as parameter. For example, ``MatrixKind()``\n    may be constructed with one element which represents the kind of its\n    elements.\n\n    ``Kind`` behaves in singleton-like fashion.
