The fix should involve modifying the regex pattern to include punctuation-only tags. Since the code already uses `self.config.notes` to define valid tags, I need to ensure that punctuation-only tags are included in the configuration or pattern. However, the configuration is set via `--notes`, and the current implementation does not explicitly include punctuation-only tags. I will now modify the code to ensure that punctuation-only tags are accepted by updating the regex pattern to include them.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '122i\\    # Add punctuation-only tags to notes if specified in --notes\\n    if self.config.notes and any(note.isascii and not note.isalnum() for note in self.config.notes):\\n        notes = \"|\".join(re.escape(note) for note in self.config.notes)\\n        regex_string = rf\"#\\s*({notes})\\b\"\\n        self._fixme_pattern = re.compile(regex_string, re.I)\\n    else:\\n        # Default pattern for fixme\\n        regex_string = rf\"#\\s*({self.config.notes})\\b\"\\n        self._fixme_pattern = re.compile(regex_string, re.I)' pylint/checkers/misc.py\n```\n</error>\n<error>sed: 122i\\    # Add punctuation-only tags to notes if specified in --notes\\n    if self.config.notes and any(note.isascii and not note.isalnum() for note in self.config.notes):\\n        notes = \"|\".join(re.escape(note) for note in self.config.notes)\\n        regex_string = rf\"#\\s*({notes})\\b\"\\n        self._fixme_pattern = re.compile(regex_string, re.I)\\n    else:\\n        # Default pattern for fixme\\n        regex_string = rf\"#\\s*({self.config.notes})\\b\"\\n        self._fixme_pattern = re.compile(regex_string, re.I) pylint/checkers/misc.py</error>\n<returncode>1</returncode>\n<output>\nsed: 122i\\    # Add punctuation-only tags to notes if specified in --notes\\n    if self.config.notes and any(note.isascii and not note.isalnum() for note in self.config.notes):\\n        notes = \"|\".join(re.escape(note) for note in self.config.notes)\\n        regex_string = rf\"#\\s*({notes})\\b\"\\n        self._fixme_pattern = re.compile(regex_string, re.I)\\n    else:\\n        # Default pattern for fixme\\n        regex_string = rf\"#\\s*({self.config.notes})\\b\"\\n        self._fixme_pattern = re.compile(regex_string, re.I) pylint/checkers/misc.py\n</output>",
