Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2.

I need to locate the source of mutual_info_score in the codebase and check how it handles input arrays of object dtype. The fix likely involves ensuring that string inputs are properly validated and converted to a valid numeric type before processing. I will first check the relevant file in the codebase.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed -type f -name \"mutual_info_score.py\" -o -name \"cluster.py\" | xargs ls -la\n```",
