Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The `unique_labels` function in `multiclass.py` currently checks the types of inputs and raises a `ValueError` if there is a mix of types (e.g., string and integer). The issue arises when nullable pandas dtypes (like \"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\") are passed in, because they convert to object dtype when converted to numpy arrays, leading to type mismatches. The function needs to handle these nullable pandas dtypes by properly converting them to numpy arrays with consistent types. The current implementation checks `type_of_target` and `is_array_api`, but it does not account for pandas nullable dtypes. I need to modify the function to ensure that when inputs are pandas Series with nullable dtypes, they are converted to numpy arrays with consistent types (e.g., int64, float64, bool) before type checking. This requires updating the type checking logic to handle pandas nullable dtypes properly.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/type_of_target/consistent_type_of_target/' /testbed/sklearn/utils/multiclass.py\n```\n\nThis command is not correct because it does not properly address the issue.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `unique_labels` function in `multiclass.py` currently checks the types of inputs and raises a `ValueError` if there is a mix of types (e.g., string and integer). The issue arises when nullable pandas dtypes (like \"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\") are passed in, because they convert to object dtype when converted to numpy arrays, leading to type mismatches. The function needs to handle these nullable pandas dtypes by properly converting them to numpy arrays with consistent types. The current implementation checks `type_of_target` and `is_array_api`, but it does not account for pandas nullable dtypes. I need to modify the function to ensure that when inputs are pandas Series with nullable dtypes, they are converted to numpy arrays with consistent types (e.g., int64, float64, bool) before type checking. This requires updating the type checking logic to handle pandas nullable dtypes properly.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/type_of_target/consistent_type_of_target/' /testbed/sklearn/utils/multiclass.py\n```\n\nThis command is not correct because it does not properly address the issue.
