The problem occurs because during the backward operation, the index is not properly handled when it's unnamed, and during the forward operation, it crashes when trying to create a relation that already exists. The key issue is in the `database_backwards` method of the `RenameIndex` operation, which currently does nothing when dealing with unnamed indices. This means that the index state is not properly restored, leading to a crash when the forward operation tries to create the index again.

This means that the index state is not properly restored, leading to a crash when the forward operation tries to create the index again. To fix this, we need to ensure that the index is properly handled during the backward operation by restoring the old auto-generated name. This can be achieved by modifying the `database_backwards` method to restore the old name if the index was initially unnamed.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/    def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):/    def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):/g; s/        if self.old_fields:/        if self.old_fields:/' /testbed/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\n```\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n29539 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\ndex(model, old_index, new_index)\n\n    def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n        if self.old_fields:\n            # Backward operation with unnamed index is a no-op.\n            return\n\n        self.new_name_lower, self.old_name_lower = (\n            self.old_name_lower,\n            self.new_name_lower,\n        )\n        self.new_name, self.old_name = self.old_name, self.new_name\n\n        self.database_forwards(app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)\n\n        self.new_name_lower, self.old_name_lower = (\n            self.old_name_lower,\n            self.new_name_lower,\n        )\n        self.new_name, self.old_name = self.old_name, self.new_name\n\n    def describe(self):\n        if self.old_name:\n            return (\n                f\"Rename index {self.old_name} on {self.model_name} to {self.new_name}\"\n            )\n        return (\n            f\"Rename unnamed index for {self.old_fields} on {self.model_name} to \"\n            f\"{self.new_name}\"\n        )\n\n    @property\n    def migration_name_fragment(self):\n        if self.old_name:\n            return \"rename_%s_%s\" % (self.old_name_lower, self.new_name_lower)\n        return \"rename_%s_%s_%s\" % (\n            self.model_name_lower,\n            \"_\".join(self.old_fields),\n            self.new_name_lower,\n        )\n\n    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n        if (\n            isinstance(operation, RenameIndex)\n            and self.model_name_lower == operation.model_name_lower\n            and operation.old_name\n            and self.new_name_lower == operation.old_name_lower\n        ):\n            return [\n                RenameIndex(\n                    self.model_name,\n                    new_name=operation.new_name,\n                    old_name=self.old_name,\n                    old_fields=self.old_fields,\n                )\n            ]\n        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n</output_tail>",
