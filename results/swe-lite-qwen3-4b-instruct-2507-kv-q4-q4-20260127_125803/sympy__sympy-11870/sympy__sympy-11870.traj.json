This is much faster, but has potentially worse\n    results. However, if the input is a polynomial, then the result is\n    guaranteed to be an equivalent polynomial of minimal degree.\n\n    The most important option is hints. Its entries can be any of the\n    following:\n\n    - a natural number\n    - a function\n    - an iterable of the form (func, var1, var2, ...)\n    - anything else, interpreted as a generator\n\n    A number is used to indicate that the search space should be increased.\n    A function is used to indicate that said function is likely to occur in a\n    simplified expression.\n    An iterable is used indicate that func(var1 + var2 + ...) is likely to\n    occur in a simplified .\n    An additional generator also indicates that it is likely to occur.\n    (See examples below).\n\n    This routine carries out various computationally intensive algorithms.\n    The option ``quick=True`` can be used to suppress one particularly slow\n    step (at the expense of potentially more complicated results, but never at\n    the expense of increased total degree).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> from sympy import sin, tan, cos, sinh, cosh, tanh\n    >>> from sympy.simplify.trigsimp import trigsimp_groebner\n\n    Suppose you want to simplify ``sin(x)*cos(x)``. Naively, nothing happens:\n\n    >>> ex = sin(x)*cos(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex)\n    sin(x)*cos(x)\n\n    This is because ``trigsimp_groebner`` only looks for a simplification\n    involving just ``sin(x)`` and ``cos(x)``. You can tell it to also try\n    ``2*x`` by passing ``hints=[2]``:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[2])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)**2 - cos(x)**2, hints=[2])\n    -cos(2*x)\n\n    Increasing the search space this way can quickly become expensive. A much\n    faster way is to give a specific expression that is likely to occur:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[sin(2*x)])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n\n    Hyperbolic expressions are similarly supported:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(2*x)/sinh(x))\n    2*cosh(x)\n\n    Note how no hints had to be passed, since the expression already involved\n    ``2*x``.\n\n    The tangent function is also supported. You can either pass ``tan`` in the\n    hints, to indicate that than should be tried whenever cosine or sine are,\n    or you can pass a specific generator:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)/cos(x), hints=[tan])\n    tan(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(x)/cosh(x), hints=[tanh(x)])\n    tanh(x)\n\n    Finally, you can use the iterable form to suggest that angle sum formulae\n    should be tried:\n\n    >>> ex = (tan(x) + tan(y))/(1 - tan(x)*tan(y))\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[(tan, x, y)])\n    tan(x + y)\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO\n    #  - preprocess by replacing everything by funcs we can handle\n    # - optionally use cot instead of tan\n    # - more intelligent hinting.\n    #     For example, if the ideal is small, and we have sin(x), sin(y),\n    #     add sin(x + y) automatically... ?\n    # - algebraic numbers ...\n    # - expressions of lowest degree are not distinguished properly\n    #   e.g. 1 - sin(x)**2\n    # - we could try to order the generators intelligently, so as to influence\n    #   which monomials appear in the quotient basis\n\n    # THEORY\n    # ------\n    # Ratsimpmodprime above can be used to \"s\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n34299 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\n      was = None\n            while m and was != expr:\n                was = expr\n                if m[a_t] == 0 or \\\n                        -m[a_t] in m[c].args or m[a_t] + m[c] == 0:\n                    break\n                if d in m and m[a_t]*m[d] + m[c] == 0:\n                    break\n                expr = result.subs(m)\n                m = expr.match(pattern)\n                m.setdefault(c, S.Zero)\n\n    elif expr.is_Mul or expr.is_Pow or deep and expr.args:\n        expr = expr.func(*[_trigsimp(a, deep) for a in expr.args])\n\n    try:\n        if not expr.has(*_trigs):\n            raise TypeError\n        e = expr.atoms(exp)\n        new = expr.rewrite(exp, deep=deep)\n        if new == e:\n            raise TypeError\n        fnew = factor(new)\n        if fnew != new:\n            new = sorted([new, factor(new)], key=count_ops)[0]\n        # if all exp that were introduced disappeared then accept it\n        if not (new.atoms(exp) - e):\n            expr = new\n    except TypeError:\n        pass\n\n    return expr\n#------------------- end of old trigsimp routines --------------------\n\n\ndef futrig(e, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Return simplified ``e`` using Fu-like transformations.\n    This is not the \"Fu\" algorithm.
