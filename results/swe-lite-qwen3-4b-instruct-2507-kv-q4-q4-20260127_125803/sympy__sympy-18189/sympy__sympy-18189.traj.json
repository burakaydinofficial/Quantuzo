Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

The elements of the\n    tuple are the solutions for each variable in the equation and\n    are arranged according to the alphabetic ordering of the variables.\n    e.g. For an equation with two variables, `a` and `b`, the first\n    element of the tuple is the solution for `a` and the second for `b`.\n\n    Usage\n    =====\n\n    ``diophantine(eq, t, syms)``: Solve the diophantine\n    equation ``eq``.\n    ``t`` is the optional parameter to be used by ``diop_solve()``.\n    ``syms`` is an optional list of symbols which determines the\n    order of the elements in the returned tuple.\n\n    By default, only the base solution is returned. If ``permute`` is set to\n    True then permutations of the base solution and/or permutations of the\n    signs of the values will be returned when applicable.\n\n    >>> from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diophantine\n    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b\n    >>> eq = a**4 + b**4 - (2**4 + 3**4)\n    >>> diophantine(eq)\n    {(2, 3)}\n    >>> diophantine(eq, permute=True)\n    {(-3, -2), (-3, 2), (-2, -3), (-2, 3), (2, -3), (2, 3), (3, -2), (3, 2)}\n\n    Details\n    =======\n\n    ``eq`` should be an expression which is assumed to be zero.\n    ``t`` is the parameter to be used in the solution.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n    >>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)\n    {(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)}\n\n    >>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))\n    {(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n89228 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\n       raise ValueError(filldedent('''\n    Expecting positive integers for `(p, k)`, but got `(%s, %s)`'''\n    % (p, k)))\n\n    if n == 0:\n        if zeros:\n            yield (0,)*k\n        return\n\n    if k == 1:\n        if p == 1:\n            yield (n,)\n        else:\n            be = perfect_power(n)\n            if be:\n                b, e = be\n                d, r = divmod(e, p)\n                if not r:\n                    yield (b**d,)\n        return\n\n    if p == 1:\n        for t in partition(n, k, zeros=zeros):\n            yield t\n        return\n\n    if p == 2:\n        feasible = _can_do_sum_of_squares(n, k)\n        if not feasible:\n            return\n        if not zeros and n > 33 and k >= 5 and k <= n and n - k in (\n                13, 10, 7, 5, 4, 2, 1):\n            '''Todd G.
