This means the condition `app.builder.name.startswith(\"epub\")` should evaluate to `True`. Since the configuration `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False` by default and the condition correctly checks for EPUB builder and disabled viewcode, the issue might be in how the configuration is being read or passed to the `viewcode` extension. The code in `doctree_read` correctly checks the condition, but it might not be properly respecting the configuration value.
