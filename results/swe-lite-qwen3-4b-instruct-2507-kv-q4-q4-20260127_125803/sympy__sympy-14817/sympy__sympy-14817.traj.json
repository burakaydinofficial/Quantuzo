                "content": "THOUGHT: The issue in the `_print_MatAdd` method is that it incorrectly accesses `item.args[0]` on a MatrixSymbol, which does not have an `args` attribute. This leads to a `SympifyError` when trying to evaluate `S(item.args[0]).is_negative`. The correct approach is to avoid using `args` on MatrixSymbol and instead handle the addition of matrix expressions properly. The fix should replace the invalid `item.args[0]` access with a valid check, such as `item.is_negative`, and ensure that the formatting logic correctly builds the expression without attempting to parse it. I will now apply a targeted fix to replace the problematic line in the `_print_MatAdd` method.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if S(item.args\\[0\\]).is_negative:/if item.is_negative:/g' /testbed/sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\n```",
