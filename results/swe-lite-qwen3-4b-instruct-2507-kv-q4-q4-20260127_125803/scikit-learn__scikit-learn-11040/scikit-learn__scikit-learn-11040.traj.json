If Cython supported polymorphism, we would be able to\n# create a subclass and derive KDTree and BallTree from it.  Because\n# polymorphism is not an option, we use this single BinaryTree class\n# as a literal include to avoid duplicating the entire file.\n#\n# A series of functions are implemented in kd_tree.pyx and ball_tree.pyx\n# which use the information here to calculate the lower and upper bounds\n# between a node and a point, and between two nodes.  These functions are\n# used here, and are all that are needed to differentiate between the two\n# tree types.\n#\n# Description of Binary Tree Algorithms\n# -------------------------------------\n# A binary tree can be thought of as a collection of nodes.  The top node\n# contains all the points.  The next level consists of two nodes with half\n# the points in each, and this continues recursively.  Each node contains\n# metadata which allow fast computation of distance bounds: in the case of\n# a ball tree, the metadata is a center and a radius.  In the case of a\n# KD tree, the metadata is the minimum and maximum bound along each dimension.\n#\n# In a typical KD Tree or Ball Tree implementation, the nodes are implemented\n# as dynamically allocated structures with pointers linking them.  Here we\n# take a different approach, storing all relevant data in a set of arrays\n# so that the entire tree object can be saved in a pickle file. For efficiency,\n# the data can be stored in such a way that explicit pointers are not\n# necessary: for node data stored at index i, the two child nodes are at\n# index (2 * i + 1) and (2 * i + 2); the parent node is (i - 1) // 2\n# (where // indicates integer division).\n#\n# The data arrays used here are as follows:\n#   data : the [n_samples x n_features] array of data from which the tree\n#          is built\n#   idx_array : the length n_samples array used to keep track of the indices\n#          of data within each node.  Each node has values idx_start and\n#          idx_end: the points within the node are given by (using numpy\n#          syntax) data[idx_array[idx_start:idx_end]].\n#   node_data : the length n_nodes array of structures which store the node\n#          indices, node radii, and leaf information for each node.\n#   node_bounds : the [* x n_nodes x n_features] array containing the node\n#          bound information.  For ball tree, the first dimension is 1, and\n#          each row contains the centroid of the node.  For kd tree, the first\n#          dimension is 2 and the rows for each point contain the arrays of\n#          lower bounds and upper bounds in each direction.\n#\n# The lack of dynamic allocation means the number of nodes must be computed\n# before the building of the tree. This can be done assuming the points are\n# divided equally between child nodes at each step; although this removes\n# some flexibility in tree creation, it ensures a balanced tree and ensures\n# that the number of nodes required can be computed beforehand.  Given a\n# specified leaf_size (the minimum number of points in any node), it is\n# possible to show that a balanced tree will have\n#\n#     n_levels = 1 + max(0, floor(log2((n_samples - 1) / leaf_size)))\n#\n# in order to satisfy\n#\n#     leaf_size <= min(n_points) <= 2 * leaf_size\n#\n# with the exception of the special case where n_samples < leaf_size.\n# for a given number of levels, the number of nodes in the tree is given by\n#\n#     n_nodes = 2 ** n_levels - 1\n#\n# both these results can be straightforwardly shown by induction.  The\n# following code uses these values in the construction of the tree.\n#\n# Distance Metrics\n# ----------------\n# For flexibility, the trees can be built using a variety of distance metrics.\n# The metrics are described in the DistanceMetric class: the standard\n# Euclidean distance is the default, and is inlined to be faster than other\n# metrics.  In addition, each metric defines both a distance and a\n# \"reduced distance\", which is often faster to compute, and is therefore\n# used in the query architecture whenever possible. (For example, in the\n# case of the standard Euclidean distance, the reduced distance is the\n# squared-distance).\n#\n# Implementation Notes\n# --------------------\n# This implementation uses the common object-oriented approach of having an\n# abstract base class which is extended by the KDTree and BallTree\n# specializations.\n#\n# The BinaryTree \"base class\" is defined here and then subclassed in the BallTree\n# and KDTree pyx files. These files include implementations of the\n# \"abstract\" methods.\n\n# Necessary Helper Functions\n# --------------------------\n# These are the names and descriptions of the \"abstract\" functions which are\n# defined in kd_tree.py\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n93781 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\n i_node1,\n                             BinaryTree other, ITYPE_t i_node2,\n                             DTYPE_t* r, ITYPE_t* count,\n                             ITYPE_t i_min, ITYPE_t i_max) except -1:\n        \"\"\"recursive dual-tree two-point correlation function query\"\"\"\n        cdef DTYPE_t* data1 = &self.data[0, 0]\n        cdef DTYPE_t* data2 = &other.data[0, 0]\n        cdef ITYPE_t* idx_array1 = &self.idx_array[0]\n        cdef ITYPE_t* idx_array2 = &other.idx_array[0]\n        cdef NodeData_t node_info1 = self.node_data[i_node1]\n        cdef NodeData_t node_info2 = other.node_data[i_node2]\n\n        cdef ITYPE_t n_features = self.data.shape[1]\n\n        cdef ITYPE_t i1, i2, j, Npts\n        cdef DTYPE_t reduced_r\n\n        cdef DTYPE_t dist_pt, dist_LB = 0, dist_UB = 0\n        dist_LB = min_dist_dual(self, i_node1, other, i_node2)\n        dist_UB = max_dist_dual(self, i_node1, other, i_node2)\n\n        #------------------------------------------------------------\n        # Go through bounds and check for cuts\n        while i_min < i_max:\n            if dist_LB > r[i_min]:\n                i_min += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        while i_max > i_min:\n            Npts = ((node_info1.idx_end -
