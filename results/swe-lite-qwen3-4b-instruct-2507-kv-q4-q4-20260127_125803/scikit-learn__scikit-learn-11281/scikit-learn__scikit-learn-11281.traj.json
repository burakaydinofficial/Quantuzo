To align it with clusterers, I need to ensure it has an `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), stores `labels_` in the fitted model, and includes a `fit_predict` method. The current file already has an `n_components` parameter, but it does not store `labels_` or have a `fit_predict` method. I will now modify the file to add the `labels_` attribute and implement the `fit_predict` method. Since the file is large, I will focus on the relevant sections of the code, particularly the `fit` and `predict` methods, and add the `labels_` attribute in the `fit` method.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def fit/def fit:\\n    self.labels_ = None/' sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def predict/ a\\\\n    return self.labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def fit_predict/ a\\\\n    return self.fit(X).labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py\n```\n\nThis command adds the `labels_` attribute in the `fit` method and ensures the `fit_predict` method calls `fit` and returns the labels. The changes are made in a single command to ensure consistency and avoid multiple edits. The `labels_` attribute will be set during the `fit` call, and `fit_predict` will be implemented by calling `fit` and returning the labels. This makes the mixture model more clusterer-compatible.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def fit/def fit:\\n    self.labels_ = None/' sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def predict/ a\\\\n    return self.labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def fit_predict/ a\\\\n    return self.fit(X).labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `gaussian_mixture.py` file contains the implementation of the Gaussian Mixture Model. To align it with clusterers, I need to ensure it has an `n_components` parameter (similar to `n_clusters`), stores `labels_` in the fitted model, and includes a `fit_predict` method. The current file already has an `n_components` parameter, but it does not store `labels_` or have a `fit_predict` method. I will now modify the file to add the `labels_` attribute and implement the `fit_predict` method. Since the file is large, I will focus on the relevant sections of the code, particularly the `fit` and `predict` methods, and add the `labels_` attribute in the `fit` method.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def fit/def fit:\\n    self.labels_ = None/' sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def predict/ a\\\\n    return self.labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def fit_predict/ a\\\\n    return self.fit(X).labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py\n```\n\nThis command adds the `labels_` attribute in the `fit` method and ensures the `fit_predict` method calls `fit` and returns the labels. The changes are made in a single command to ensure consistency and avoid multiple edits. The `labels_` attribute will be set during the `fit` call, and `fit_predict` will be implemented by calling `fit` and returning the labels. This makes the mixture model more clusterer-compatible.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/def fit/def fit:\\n    self.labels_ = None/' sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def predict/ a\\\\n    return self.labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py && \\\nsed -i '/def fit_predict/ a\\\\n    return self.fit(X).labels_/ sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py\n```",
