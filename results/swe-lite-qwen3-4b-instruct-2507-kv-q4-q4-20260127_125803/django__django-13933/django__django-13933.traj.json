Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first.

The error message in `ModelMultipleChoiceField` uses `%(value)s` to show the invalid value. I need to update the `ModelChoiceField` class in `/testbed/django/forms/fields.py` to include a default error message for `invalid_choice` that contains `%(value)s`. This will ensure consistent error messaging behavior with other fields.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/default_error_messages = {.*}/default_error_messages = {\\n    \\\"invalid_choice\\\": _(\\\"Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the available choices.\\\")}/' /testbed/django/forms/fields.py\n```",
