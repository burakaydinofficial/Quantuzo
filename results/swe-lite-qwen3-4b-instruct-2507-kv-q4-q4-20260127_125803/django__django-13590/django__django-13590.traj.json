This works fine on 2.2.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The `sed` command successfully modified the code in `resolve_lookup_value` to use `*` unpacking when constructing the new tuple. This change ensures that the elements of the tuple are properly expanded and resolved, avoiding the TypeError that occurs when passing an iterator directly to a named tuple constructor. The fix is consistent with the PR description, which states that the issue arises because Django attempts to reconstitute the tuple with resolved elements, and the solution is to expand the contents of the iterator. This change will now work correctly for named tuples in all cases, as the elements will be unpacked properly before being passed to the tuple constructor.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
