It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error.

The problem occurs in the `_hstack` method where it tries to set `output.columns = names_out` without properly filtering out transformers with zero features. The fix should ensure that transformers with zero features are not included in the feature names list when constructing the output columns. I need to modify the code to skip transformers with zero features when building the feature names list. The key is in the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` method and how it handles transformers with no features.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"self._iter(fitted=True)\" sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\n```",
