Since the PR description refers to `GaussianMixture` in scikit-learn, I should look for the actual implementation file. The most likely location is within the scikit-learn source code, specifically in a file related to mixture models. I will now search for the main mixture model file, which is likely named `mixture.py` or `gaussian_mixture.py`, in the scikit-learn source directory.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed -type f -name \"mixture.py\" | xargs grep -l \"GaussianMixture\"\n```\n</thought>",

Given that the `fit_predict` method is likely implemented in a way that calls `fit` and then `predict`, and that the final model state must be consistent, I will now directly replace the implementation of the `fit_predict` method with a correct version that ensures consistency between `fit_predict` and `predict`.\n\nI will now directly modify the `fit_predict` method to ensure that it uses the same fitted model state as `predict` by replacing the current implementation with a correct one.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/fit_predict.*predict/fit_predict should use the same fitted model as predict/g' /testbed/skimiento/gaussian_mixture.py\n```\n</thought>",
