                "content": "THOUGHT: The sed command successfully updated the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION setting to 0o644 in django/conf/global_settings.py. Since no output was returned, this indicates the change was made successfully without errors. The change ensures that file upload permissions are consistently set to 0o644 by default, addressing the issue described in the PR description. This is a general and consistent fix that aligns with the codebase's expectations.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
