      "content": "THOUGHT: The issue described involves SymPy's simplification of trigonometric expressions with rational numbers. The problem occurs when simplifying expressions like `sin(Rational(1,50)) * sin(Rational(1,25)) + cos(Rational(1,50)) * cos(Rational(1,25)))`, where the expected simplification to `cos(1/50 - 1/25)` is not happening. This suggests a missing or incorrect implementation in SymPy's trigonometric simplification logic. I need to locate the relevant SymPy source files that handle trigonometric simplification, particularly in the context of rational arguments. The most likely location would be in the core trigonometric simplification functions, possibly in `sympy/simplify.py` or related files.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed -type f -name \"simplify.py\" -o -name \"trig.py\" -o -name \"core.py\" | xargs grep -l \"cos\" | xargs grep -l \"sin\"\n```\n</thought>",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The issue described involves SymPy's simplification of trigonometric expressions with rational numbers. The problem occurs when simplifying expressions like `sin(Rational(1,50)) * sin(Rational(1,25)) + cos(Rational(1,50)) * cos(Rational(1,25)))`, where the expected simplification to `cos(1/50 - 1/25)` is not happening. This suggests a missing or incorrect implementation in SymPy's trigonometric simplification logic. I need to locate the relevant SymPy source files that handle trigonometric simplification, particularly in the context of rational arguments. The most likely location would be in the core trigonometric simplification functions, possibly in `sympy/simplify.py` or related files.\n\n```bash\nfind /testbed -type f -name \"simplify.py\" -o -name \"trig.py\" -o -name \"core.py\" | xargs grep -l \"cos\" | xargs grep -l \"sin\"\n```\n</thought>",

The primary metric is the\n    total degree. Some attempts are made to choose the simplest possible\n    expression of the minimal degree, but this is non-rigorous, and also\n    very slow (see the ``quick=True`` option).\n\n    If ``polynomial`` is set to True, instead of simplifying numerator and\n    denominator together, this function just brings numerator and denominator\n    into a canonical form. This is much faster, but has potentially worse\n    results. However, if the input is a polynomial, then the result is\n    guaranteed to be an equivalent polynomial of minimal degree.\n\n    The most important option is hints.

Naively, nothing happens:\n\n    >>> ex = sin(x)*cos(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex)\n    sin(x)*cos(x)\n\n    This is because ``trigsimp_groebner`` only looks for a simplification\n    involving just ``sin(x)`` and ``cos(x)``. You can tell it to also try\n    ``2*x`` by passing ``hints=[2]``:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[2])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)**2 - cos(x)**2, hints=[2])\n    -cos(2*x)\n\n    Increasing the search space this way can quickly become expensive. A much\n    faster way is to give a specific expression that is likely to occur:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[sin(2*x)])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n\n    Hyperbolic expressions are similarly supported:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(2*x)/sinh(x))\n    2*cosh(x)\n\n    Note how no hints had to be passed, since the expression already involved\n    ``2*x``.\n\n    The tangent function is also supported. You can either pass ``tan`` in the\n    hints, to indicate that than should be tried whenever cosine or sine are,\n    or you can pass a specific generator:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)/cos(x), hints=[tan])\n    tan(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(x)/cosh(x), hints=[tanh(x)])\n    tanh(x)\n\n    Finally, you can use the iterable form to suggest that angle sum formulae\n    should be tried:\n\n    >>> ex = (tan(x) + tan(y))/(1 - tan(x)*tan(y))\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[(tan, x, y)])\n    tan(x + y)\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO\n    #  - preprocess by replacing everything by funcs we can handle\n    # - optionally use cot instead of tan\n    # - more intelligent hinting.\n    #     For example, if the ideal is small, and we have sin(x), sin(y),\n    #     add sin(x + y) automatically... ?\n    # - algebraic numbers ...\n    # - expressions of lowest degree are not distinguished properly\n    #   e.g. 1 - sin(x)**2\n    # - we could try to order the generators intelligently, so as to influence\n    #   which monomials appear in the quotient basis\n\n    # THEORY\n    # ------\n    # Ratsimpmodprime above can be used to \"simplify\" a rational function\n    # modulo a prime ideal. \"Simplify\" mainly means finding an equivalent\n    # expression of lower total degree.\n    #\n    # We intend to use this to simplify trigonometric functions.
