The issue is that the type hints are not being respected when autodoc_typehints is set to 'none' or other values. The `autodoc_typehints` setting is likely used in the `get_signature` or `get_type_hint` methods, but it's not being applied to overloaded signatures. I need to locate where `autodoc_typehints` is used in the autodoc logic and ensure it's applied to overloaded function signatures. The most likely place is in the `get_signature` method or in the type hint processing logic. I will now check the type hint handling code in autodoc.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"autodoc_typehints\" sphinx/ext/autodoc/\n```",
