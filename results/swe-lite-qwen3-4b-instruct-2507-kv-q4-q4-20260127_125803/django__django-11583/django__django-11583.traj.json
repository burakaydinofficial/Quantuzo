The issue occurs when resolving paths, and the error suggests a null byte in the path string. The current code does not validate the path string before resolving it. To mitigate this, I should add a check to ensure the path string does not contain null bytes before attempting to resolve it. This would prevent the ValueError from being raised. I will modify the code to skip path resolution if the path contains a null byte.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()|if b\"\\x00\" not in path.as_posix():\\n    resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\\nelse:\\n    # Skip this path to avoid null byte error\\n    print(f\"Skipping path with null byte: {path}\")|g' /testbed/django/utils/autoreload.py\n```",
