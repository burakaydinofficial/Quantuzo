                "content": "THOUGHT: The `sed` command successfully modified the `through_fields` assignment in the `ManyToManyRel` class to include `make_hashable(through_fields)`. This change ensures that `through_fields` is hashable when used in reverse relationships, which resolves the `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` issue. The fix is now applied to the correct file and location, addressing the core issue described in the PR.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
