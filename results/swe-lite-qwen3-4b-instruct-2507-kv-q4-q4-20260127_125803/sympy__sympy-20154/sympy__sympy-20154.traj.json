This suggests that the file might be located in a different path or that the module structure is different. Given that the PR description refers to `sympy.utilities.iterables`, I should check if the file exists in a path that might be more standard, such as `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`. Since the file is not found in the expected locations, I will now search for the file recursively in the testbed directory to locate it.\n\n```bash\nfind testbed -type f -name \"iterables.py\" | grep -E \"sympy/utilities\"\n```",
