                "content": "THOUGHT: The modification to the ResolverMatch.__init__ method has been successfully applied. The changes now unwrap functools.partial objects and extract the underlying function name and its arguments (as a tuple) in the _func_path attribute. This ensures that when __repr__ is called, it will show the actual function and arguments, making it more informative and useful for debugging. The changes are now in place and consistent with the PR description.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
