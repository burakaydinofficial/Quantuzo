Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

      "content": "THOUGHT: I have now identified the key issue in the code. The `BlockDiagMatrix` class in `/testbed/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py` has a method that converts a BlockMatrix to a regular Matrix when the blockshape is (1,1). However, this method fails when there's only one element because it tries to access elements of a singleton matrix. The method `if isinstance(expr.arg, BlockMatrix) and expr.arg.blockshape == (1, 1):` creates a Matrix from the inverse of the single element, but this doesn't handle the case where the element is already a Matrix.\n\nThe issue is that the code assumes that the single element is a MatrixExpr that can be inverted, but it doesn't properly handle the case where the element is a single Matrix.
