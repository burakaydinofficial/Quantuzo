The change ensures that the `method_decorator` function properly wraps the function being decorated and applies `@wraps` to preserve the original function's attributes like `__name__`. This should resolve the issue where the `functools.partial` object lacks attributes such as `__name__`. The fix is now in place and consistent with the codebase.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
