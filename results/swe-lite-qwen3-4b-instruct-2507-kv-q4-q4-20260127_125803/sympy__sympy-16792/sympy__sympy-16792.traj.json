      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nautowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

                "content": "THOUGHT: I have now thoroughly analyzed the `_prototype_arg` method in autowrap.py. The method is responsible for generating the prototype of function arguments in the C code. The issue is that it currently does not properly handle array arguments when they are passed to the function but not used in the expression. The method currently generates a prototype for array arguments using a format that creates a numpy array type, but it should generate a pointer type for array arguments in the C function signature.\n\nI need to modify the `_prototype_arg` method to ensure that array arguments are properly typed as pointers in the generated C function signature. The method should return \"double *arg_name\" for array arguments and \"double arg_name\" for scalar arguments. The current implementation uses a format that creates a numpy array type, but it should be changed to use a pointer type for array arguments.\n\nI will now modify the `_prototype_arg` method to ensure that array arguments are properly typed as pointers in the generated C function signature. The change should be made in the specific part of the method that generates the argument prototype for array arguments.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/return mat_dec.format(mtype=mtype, ndim=ndim, name=self._string_var(arg.name)) /return \"double *%s\" % (self._string_var(arg.name)) if arg.dimensions else \"double %s\" % (self._string_var(arg.name)) /' /testbed/sympy/utilities/autowrap.py\n```\n\n</output>",
