The change is now in the codebase and should correctly support full inverse trig function names as required by the PR description. The modification is general and consistent with the existing codebase structure.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
