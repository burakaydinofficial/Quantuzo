      "content": "THOUGHT: The issue is in the `KeyTransform` logic for SQLite and Oracle databases when `__isnull=True` is used. The current implementation in `KeyTransform` does not properly exclude objects with a key that has a null value. Looking at the code, the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup is handled in the `KeyTransform` class, and specifically in the `as_sql` method for Oracle and SQLite. The problem is that for SQLite and Oracle, when `__isnull=True`, it incorrectly matches objects with a key that has a null value instead of only those without the key. The fix should ensure that for these databases, the query only matches objects that lack the key entirely.\n\nI need to modify the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup to correctly handle SQLite and Oracle by ensuring it only matches objects that do not have the key. The current implementation in `KeyTransform` does not properly handle this case. I will edit the file to ensure that when `__isnull=True`, the query matches only objects that do not have the key, regardless of whether the value is null or not.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/KeyTransformIsNull.*$/KeyTransformIsNull(lookup, True) in KeyTransform.as_sql()/g' /testbed/django/db/models/fields/json.py\n```\n\nWait, this is not correct.

                "content": "THOUGHT: The issue is in the `KeyTransform` logic for SQLite and Oracle databases when `__isnull=True` is used. The current implementation in `KeyTransform` does not properly exclude objects with a key that has a null value. Looking at the code, the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup is handled in the `KeyTransform` class, and specifically in the `as_sql` method for Oracle and SQLite. The problem is that for SQLite and Oracle, when `__isnull=True`, it incorrectly matches objects with a key that has a null value instead of only those without the key. The fix should ensure that for these databases, the query only matches objects that lack the key entirely.\n\nI need to modify the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup to correctly handle SQLite and Oracle by ensuring it only matches objects that do not have the key. The current implementation in `KeyTransform` does not properly handle this case. I will edit the file to ensure that when `__isnull=True`, the query matches only objects that do not have the key, regardless of whether the value is null or not.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/KeyTransformIsNull.*$/KeyTransformIsNull(lookup, True) in KeyTransform.as_sql()/g' /testbed/django/db/models/fields/json.py\n```\n\nWait, this is not correct. The actual issue is in the `KeyTransform` class's handling of `__isnull=True` for SQLite and Oracle. I need to locate the specific part of the code that handles `__isnull=True` and modify it to correctly exclude objects with a key that has a null value. Looking at the code, the issue is in the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup, specifically in the `as_sql` method for Oracle and SQLite.\n\nI will now edit the correct part of the code to ensure that for SQLite and Oracle, when `__isnull=True`, the query only matches objects that do not have the key.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/KeyTransformIsNull(lookup, True) in KeyTransform.as_sql()/KeyTransformIsNull(lookup, True) in KeyTransform.as_sql() and not has_key_expr/g' /testbed/django/db/models/fields/json.py\n```\n\nThis is still not correct.
