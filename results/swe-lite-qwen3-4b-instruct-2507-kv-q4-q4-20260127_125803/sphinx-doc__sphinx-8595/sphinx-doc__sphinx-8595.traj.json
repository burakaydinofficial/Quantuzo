      "content": "THOUGHT: The key part of the code is in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. The issue is that when `__all__` is empty, all members are still being included. The logic in `get_object_members` and `filter_members` shows that it checks `if not want_all` and then filters members using `self.__all__`, but it doesn't respect an empty `__all__` list. Specifically, in the `filter_members` method, it checks `if member.__name__ not in self.__all__` only when `want_all` is False. However, if `__all__` is empty, it should not include any members. I need to modify the logic to ensure that when `__all__` is empty, no members are included. The fix should be in the `filter_members` method where it checks if `self.__all__` is empty and skips all members in that case.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if not want_all:\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*if

                "content": "THOUGHT: The key part of the code is in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. The issue is that when `__all__` is empty, all members are still being included. The logic in `get_object_members` and `filter_members` shows that it checks `if not want_all` and then filters members using `self.__all__`, but it doesn't respect an empty `__all__` list. Specifically, in the `filter_members` method, it checks `if member.__name__ not in self.__all__` only when `want_all` is False. However, if `__all__` is empty, it should not include any members. I need to modify the logic to ensure that when `__all__` is empty, no members are included. The fix should be in the `filter_members` method where it checks if `self.__all__` is empty and skips all members in that case.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's|if not want_all:\\\\s*\\\\s*\\\\s*if
