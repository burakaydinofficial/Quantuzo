Given that the PR is about a recursion error in `is_zero` for a `cosh(acos(...))` expression, the issue likely stems from how SymPy evaluates or simplifies such expressions. A common source of such bugs is in the `is_zero` method of expressions, particularly in the core expression evaluation logic. The file `sympy/core/expr.py` is a central file where `is_zero` is likely implemented.
