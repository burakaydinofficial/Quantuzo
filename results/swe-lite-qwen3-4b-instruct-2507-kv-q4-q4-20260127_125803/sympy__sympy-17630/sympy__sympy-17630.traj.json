The error occurs in the `colblocksizes` method, which accesses `self.blocks[0, i].cols` for each column block. Since the zero blocks are being treated as `Zero` objects (not `ZeroMatrix`), they don't have the `.cols` attribute.

The error occurs in the `colblocksizes` method, which accesses `self.blocks[0, i].cols` for each column block.
